	<p>My name is Jacob. I do a lot of things and get the opportunity to do a lot of professional development very regularly (both through employment and through courses I teach in higher education). You can see more information on my website.</p>
	<p>I really love professional development, teaching, and giving presentations. I believe that knowledge should be shared. I developed this platform to share my presentations so that my students have easy access to the our course content and that people in the wider community who might find it helpful or useful. The design is based on Notist. I spent a number of years posting my content on their platform at <a href="https://noti.st/campjacob/">notist/campjacob</a>. I have decided that I want to further integrate these presentations into my website so I have moved my previous presentations to here and am just using this now. As I am not highly technical, following some of their format and systems helped me in the development of this a lot.</p>
