presentation_description: >
  <p>During week ten, we continue to look at design methods. Two common methodologies that we use in developing a program evaluation are qualitative designs and consumer satisfaction. Qualitative design methods provide an opportunity to develop a deep understanding of a perspective or set of perspectives about the organization. Questionnaires and a process to understand consumer satisfaction allow us to understand how our clients are engaging with a service and their perceptions around its implementation.</p>
  <p>The agenda for today’s session is as follows:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Presentation about graduation planning</li>
  <li>Benefits of the qualitative approach</li>
  <li>Qualitative design methods</li>
  <li>Focus groups</li>
  <li>Consumer satisfaction surveys</li>
  </ul>
