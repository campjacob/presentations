      <p>Share your research questions in your group
      Do they meet the criteria for a good research question
      Do they have…
      An independent variable
      A dependent variable
      A target population
      Do they contain any “watch words”…
      IV watch words: factors, causes
      DV watch words: effects, outcomes, effective, useful, efficient
      Etc., so forth,</p>
