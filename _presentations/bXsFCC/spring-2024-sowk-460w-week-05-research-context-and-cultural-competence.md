      <p>Logic Model De inition
      A program logic model is a picture of how an organization does its work ‚Äî the theory and assumptions underlying the program. A program logic model links outcomes (both short- and long-term) with program activities/processes and the theoretical principles/assumptions of the program.

      <p>Logic Models Purpose
      ‚Ä¢ Stakeholders are allowed to articulate their views about the program ‚Ä¢ Stakeholders are allowed to hear and appreciate the views of other stakeholders ‚Ä¢ Divergent views about the program are synthesized in a collaborative process. ‚Ä¢ An integrated model is developed with stakeholder ownership ‚Ä¢ The integrated model is scrutinized publicly for feasibility ‚Ä¢ The model serves as a solid reference for program management decisions ‚Ä¢ The model is used as an organizing tool for evaluation ‚Ä¢ The model can be used as a promotional tool for the program ‚Ä¢ The model can be employed to support program proposals for grant activities Jacob Campbell, Ph.D. LICSW Heritage University

presentation_description: >
  <p>In week five, we start exploring more of the context around the program evaluation. This includes cultural competency and how we can develop culturally sensitive program evaluations. We will also start a discussion around gathering information for the logic model. The agenda is as follows:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Peer review group work plans</li>
  <li>Explore cultural competency</li>
  <li>Adding cultural sensitivity to program evaluation</li>
  <li>Introduction to logic models</li>
  </ul>
