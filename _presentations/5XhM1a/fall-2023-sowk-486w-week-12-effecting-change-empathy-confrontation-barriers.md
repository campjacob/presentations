      <p>Pitfalls of Additive Empathy
      (Hepworth, et al. 2022)
      Moderate Interpretations vs. Deep Interpretations
      • Working relationship has evolved • Engaged and ready for selfexploration
      • Pitch these responses to the edge of clients’ self-awareness
      • Avoid making several additive
      ff
      ff
      empathic responses in succession
      • Phrase interpretive responses in tentative terms
      • Note clients’ reactions after o ering the interpretation
      • Acknowledge your probable error &amp; respond empathically
      • Culturally di erences</p>

      <p>Ways of Using Additive Empathy What Context Do we Use it
      • Deeper feelings • Identify feelings implied or hinted at in clients’ verbal messages • To identify feelings that underlie surface emotions • To clarify the nature of feelings clients express only vaguely • To identify feelings manifested only nonverbally • Challenging beliefs stated as facts

      <p>Ways of Using Additive Empathy What Context Do we Use it
      • Deeper feelings • Underlying meanings of feelings, thoughts, and behavior • Wants and goals • Hidden purposes of behavior • Challenge beliefs stated as facts • Unrealized strengths and potentialities (Hepworth, et al. 2022) Jacob Campbell, Ph.D. LICSW at Heritage University

      • Role-play saying it
      With a partner take turns going through each example and offering potential interpretations.
      • Feedback from
      group members
      After you have done these steps, look at and talk about the modeled responses

      <p>Confrontation A Range of Confrontation Skills
      SelfConfrontation
      Assertive Confrontation
      When clients, in response to social workers’ questions, re ect on the relationship between their behaviors and their own values.
      Social worker-initiated confrontation in which the connection between troubling thoughts, plans, values, and beliefs is stated in declarative form, connecting them explicitly for the client.

      <p>Effective Assertive Confrontation • Expression of concern • A description of the client’s purported goal, belief, or commitment • The behavior (or absence of behavior) that is inconsistent or discrepant with the goal, belief, or commitment
      • The probable negative outcomes of the discrepant behavior
