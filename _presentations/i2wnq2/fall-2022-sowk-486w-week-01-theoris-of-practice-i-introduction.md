presentation_description: >
  <p>This first week of classes is all of your first week starting in the social work program. Theories of Practice I is a part of a three-part series of classes. In the first semester, you will look at how we work with individuals. The second semester is about working with families and groups. Finally, the third semester takes a broader approach and looks at macro practice. During the first class session, we focus on getting to know our fellow learners, the course instructor, and the general feel of the course. We will also discuss academic writing as this course is a ‚ÄúW‚Äù class.</p>
  <p>The plan is as follows:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Getting to know each other</li>
  <li>Cooperative agreements and norms</li>
  <li>The look and feel of this learning environment</li>
  <li>Academic writing</li>
  </ul>
