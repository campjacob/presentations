  <p>The readings this week are from Schulz (2017) who focus on assessing Community-Based Participatory Research Partnerships (CPBRP). Staples (2017) describes social action groups. During class we have an activity about ethics and macro practice as well as some lecture about CBPRP. The agenda is:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Community-Based Participatory Research Partnerships</li>
  <li>Ethics in community practice</li>
  </ul>
