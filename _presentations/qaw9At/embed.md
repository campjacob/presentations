      Progress Note (D)
      This writer met with Johnny and discussed his goal progress. Johnny
      reported that he has been attempting to use deep breathing when frustrated. He described a situation last week with client 13452, and the incident where he was getting into other students belongings and handling them without permission. Johnny reported taking deep breaths instead of punching 13452. This writer encouraged this positive behavior and reflected experience back to concept of “If Then Thinking.” (I) Johnny appeared cooperative. He appeared to be encouraged by the positive feedback from staff. (P) Follow up with Johnny about progress next week regarding using deep breathing. ———————— Jacob Campbe FALL 2022 FOR SOWK 486W WITH JACOB CAMPBELL, LICSW AT HERITAGE UNIVERSITY ll
