      <p>Assessments give a social worker the ability to “gathering information and formulating it into a coherent picture of the client and his or her circumstances” (p. 187)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p>When we are thinking about assessments, we generally think about them as being multidimensional.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Complex Interplay</strong>: Human problems even those that appear to be simple at first glance—often involve a complex interplay of many factors.
      <ul>
      <li>Rarely do sources of problems reside solely within an individual or within that individual’s environment.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Complex Social Institutions</strong>: The multidimensionality of human problems is a consequence of the fact that human beings are social creatures who depend both on other human beings and on complex social institutions to meet their needs.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Person’s functioning</strong>: Assessing the functioning of an individual entails evaluating various aspects of that person’s functioning.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Although a social worker’s assessment will be guided by the setting in which the assessment is conducted, certain priorities in assessment influence all social work settings.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Initially, three questions should be assessed in all situations:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>What does the client see as his or her primary concerns or goals?</li>
      <li>What (if any) current or impending legal mandates must the client and social worker consider?</li>
      <li>What (if any) potentially serious health or safety concerns might require the social worker’s and client’s attention?</li>
