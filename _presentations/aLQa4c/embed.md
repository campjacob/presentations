      <p>DEVELOPING A RESEARCH QUESTION
      To Help You Develop Your Question Consider:
      Step
      1
      What is your topic? i.e., burnout, how transitions happen, gaps in services, etc. What is the context or location of your research? i.e. DSHS, Domestic Violence, etc. What do you want to achieve? i.e. to discover, to describe, to change, to explore to explain, etc. What is the nature of your question? i.e., a what, where, how, when, or why question? Are there potential relationships you want to explore? i.e., impacts, increases, decreases, relationships, correlations, causes, etc.

This can be described as an A-B design, with A being the pre-intervention status and B representing the post-intervention status

      <p>DESCRIPTION
      The post-test only aspect of this design means that the impact of the intervention is only delivered after the intervention. The experience and success of other clients also served by the agency, who have not received the intervention is also measured.
      STRENGTHS
      LIMITATIONS
      Simplicity of the post-test-only design combined with a simple, accessible method for comparison
      Concerns abut the ability to compare nonequivalent groups and the lack of randomization mean that strong questions about the validity persist.
