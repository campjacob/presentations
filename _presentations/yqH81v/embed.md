      ▸ 3. Among the critical activities of group facilitation is related to group norms. Facilitators often call attention to group norms, reinforce group norms, or seek to in uence norms to ensure that they support the purposes of the group. Using groups that students have experienced, ask students to analyze norms through the lenses of the orienting frameworks that underlie this text— ecological systems theory, strengths perspective, cultural humility, antioppressive practice, trauma informed practice, evidence-informed practice. Identify norms that students may want to in uence based on their analysis.

      ▸ To emphasize group processes, dynamics, and development, it is useful to assign various members to play a particular role. Information may be provided on a 3 × 5 card, which is not shared with others in the group. Afterward, students should discuss and evaluate the experience, focusing on the various roles played by members, functional and dysfunctional member behavior, group development, and leader intervention. ▸ Suggested member roles include formal and informal leader or co-leader, clown, isolate, scapegoat, agitator, griper, expert, facilitator, peacemaker, advocate, spokesperson, and resource person. ▸ Spring 2024 SOWK 487 with Jacob Campbell, Ph.D. LICSW at Heritage University</p>
