      The Crisis Intervention Model: Procedures of Crisis Intervention P. 387
      A 34-year-old mother of three, aged, 5, 9, and 11 has been hospitalized following a violent confrontation with her boyfriend. In addition to her physical condition, she is depressed and concerned about her children. During the period of her hospitalization, the children lived with an aunt. As the hospital social worker, you meet with her to complete a psychosocial assessment. During the brief session, she stated, “I never want to see him again (the boyfriend). If it weren’t for my children, I would hang it all up. I seem to always end up choosing the wrong men in my life. I don’t want my kids to see me as a loser but it is true, I am. I just want to get out of here and live my life with my children in peace.” PLANNING 1

      Progress Note (D)
      This writer met with Johnny and discussed his goal progress. Johnny
      reported that he has been attempting to use deep breathing when frustrated. He described a situation last week with client 13452, and the incident where he was getting into other students belongings and handling them without permission. Johnny reported taking deep breaths instead of punching 13452. This writer encouraged this positive behavior and reflected experience back to concept of “If Then Thinking.” (I) Johnny appeared cooperative. He appeared to be encouraged by the positive feedback from staff. (P) Follow up with Johnny about progress next week regarding using deep breathing. ———————— Jacob Campbe

      <p>Developing Responses ✤
      I am here because God told me to come. How is a goal going to help me? I trust God to guide me in what to do. Do you believe in God?
      ✤
      What do you know about my situation? You are so young and it’s hard for me to see how you can help me.
      ✤
      The court will take my children no matter what I do, so how is having a goal going to help?
      ✤
      You need to be clear; I don’t want to be here. I’m only doing this stuff with you because the judge said that I had to come.
      ✤
      My family didn’t want me to come see you again. They worry that you will put too many American ideas in my head.
      ✤
      Don’t waste our time. She got herself pregnant. You want her father and me to be involved because you must think that it is okay to be unmarried and pregnant. Well, you’re wrong!
      ✤
      How will having a goal help me? I’ve never been able to accomplish anything before.
