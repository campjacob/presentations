      <p>Dialectical Process
      “
      Open place for a debate of ideas
      dialectical | ˌdīəˈlektəkəl | adjective 1 relating to the logical discussion of ideas and opinions: dialectical ingenuity.
      2 concerned with or acting through opposing forces: a dialectical opposition between artistic translation and transcription.
      Group members can listen as one member presents the thesis, and the other the antithesis. As each member listens, he or she can use the discussion to develop a personal synthesis. (Shulman, 2020, p. 347)</p>
