      <p>The readings for this week were about empowerment theory, ethics, and social justice. Whenever I think about those subjects I also get the feeling that we have to find ways to take over the world.</p>

      <p>Empowerment, Advocacy, and Leadership Activity 1 taken from (http://berkstransition.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/activity1.pdf)</p>
      <p><strong>Description</strong>: In this activity, approximately 1/3 of the participants will be given a lollipop. Each participant with a lollipop can voice their ideas and are “empowered,” while people without lollipops do not have a voice and are seen as tokens.</p>
      <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This activity can demonstrate the importance of empowerment and making sure that everyone is self-determined and has a voice.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Group Size</strong>: any size of group
      <strong>Estimated time</strong>: 15-20 minutes</p>
      <p><strong>Activity Summary</strong>: As participants are being seated (or prior to the activity), hand out lollipops to every third or fourth person (after the activity others can also have the lollipops). Participants musts be informed that the lollipops are for an activity and to wait to eat them. In this activity, participants with lollipops are people with a voice, who are empowered, and whose ideas are seen as valuable; while the participants without lollipops are seen as tokens who are not seen as having valuable ideas. This activity is meant to demonstrate the importance of empowerment and establishing your voice.</p>
      <p>Leader Instructions with a Draft Script of Directions:
      . Below there are key words that should be included in the introduction and conclusion.</p>
      <p>~Key Points~</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Give lollipops to every third to fourth participant</li>
      <li>Clearly state that the lollipops will be used for the activity and that people can get lollipops after the activity</li>
      <li>Throughout the entire activity overly emphasize how smart, amazing, beautiful, etc. the group with the lollipops are while exaggerating how much the people without lollipops are not.</li>
      <li>Introduce the icebreaker</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
      <p>State that you will be discussing how to best assist youth with
      disabilities with $1 million and want ideas from everyone</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>As you get responses, emphasize how amazing the ideas are from the people with lollipops and how much “better” they are than the others</li>
      <li>The importance here is not the ideas or ways to spend money but rather to clearly show a bias for people with lollipops</li>
      </ul>
      <p>~Concluding Points and Discussion Questions~</p>
      <ul>
      <li>After a few minutes of discussing ways to spend money end the discussion</li>
      <li>This activity wasn’t about deciding on money, it was about biases and not having your voice heard</li>
      <li>Who did we listen to? (answer: people with lollipops)</li>
      <li>We used a completely subjective and irrelevant quality as the determining factor of who we were going to listen to.</li>
      <li>Often people with disabilities may be seen as not having a lollipop and are therefore not listened to.</li>
      <li>What did it feel to not be listened to?</li>
      <li>How did you feel about the people who do have lollipops? Were you mad at them? Did you feel betrayed? Did you feel separated from them or that somehow you felt connected to other people who like you did or did not have a lollipop?</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
      <p>There are some primary principals of empowerment theory in general, not just in how it relates to working with groups.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ol>
      <li>All oppression should be fought</li>
      <li>A systematic understanding of oppression must be maintained</li>
      <li>People are capable of empowering themselves</li>
      <li>People need to connect with others to work on empowerment</li>
      <li>Clinician and the client share power</li>
      </ol>

      <ol start="6">
      <li>Client centered with the client being encouraged to tell own story &amp; develop own goals</li>
      <li>Client as “victor not victim”</li>
      <li>Social change is goal, not symptom reduction.</li>
      <li>Clinicians must examine how their practice may disempower clients</li>
      <li>Clinician may need to be socially and politically active to address meso and macro needs [local, national, global issues]</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The first step in empowerment theory is the empowering of the client.  This means helping them to gain self-efficacy.  This can be done by the following:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Skill building</li>
      <li>Gaining self-awareness</li>
      <li>Learning to navigate systems</li>
      </ul>
      
  - slide_name: deck-4725-large-8.jpeg
    slide_text: >
      <p>The second step in empowerment theory is connecting the client to the “bigger picture.”  This means helping them to gain a critical consciousness about oppression and obstacles.  Some examples of this are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Identifying barriers</li>
      <li>Defining power</li>
      <li>Connecting the client to a group</li>
      <li>Letting them know they aren’t alone</li>
      </ul>

    slide_text: >
      <p>The third step in empowerment theory is creating larger social change.  The following are some possible ideas:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Creating policy and or legal changes</li>
      <li>Having the client act as a mentor</li>
      <li>Connecting to another activity that allows them to make social change</li>
      </ul>

      <p>How a Group of Refugee-immigrant Women Living in the Diaspora in Metro-Vancouver Define Flourishing and Experience Participatory-Hospitality:
      A Feminist Participatory Action Research</p>
      <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
      <p>Refugees are a socio-political category produced by conflict; a category of humans who have become a global crisis.  To date (2019) there are an estimated 68.5 million people who are displaced from their homelands, which number includes more than 25.4 million refugees who have fled their homes because it is no longer safe to stay.  I propose the further category of refugee-immigrant to describe refugees who are living in a host country as permanent residents; the category is important firstly to locate the individuals who are no longer living in the hiatus of a refugee camp or temporary refuge country, and secondly to clearly demarcate challenges and obstacles that may not exist when one immigrates by choice.</p>
      <p>There is an absence in the literature on the experiences of refugee-immigration that include or focus on the voices of women, and a further lack of discussion on refugee-immigrant flourishing.  This research, grounded in a feminist participatory action research (FPAR) methodology, sought to discover:  How a group of refugee-immigrant women living in the diaspora in Metro-Vancouver, Canada, define flourishing?  The concept of flourishing was initially perceived by me to mean a state of wellness of mind, body, and spirt, and differentiates a state of mere survival from a state of well-being and growth.  The methodology is based in transnational feminism informed by Dérridean and Lévinasian hospitality; a methodology that is both democratic and decolonizing.</p>
      <p>The research group, self-identified as Global Women Seeking Change (Global Women), practised a host-host methodology or participatory-hospitality, a term I propose to specifically capture the nature of this methodology, that resulted in both significant social action and a sustainable community action group.  This research revealed much about the obstacles and experiences of refugee-immigration, including the main obstacles of language barriers, family reunification, and childcare, all of which impede the experience of flourishing; but primarily revealed epistemology that included potential solutions and suggestions for policy change and social innovation as they relate to family definition, education, access to resources, and housing.
      Global Women determined flourishing to be born of resilience; it may include the presence of melancholy; it includes acknowledgement of mystery; and it includes acceptance of that which appears unacceptable.  Global Women further determined that flourishing is an active, participatory, and ongoing process.</p>

  <p>This presentation is a continuation of looking at the philosphical foundations for groups. We evaluate and look at empowerment theory and collaborative action groups as a part of engaging with clients. We also delve into ethics and social justice.</p>
