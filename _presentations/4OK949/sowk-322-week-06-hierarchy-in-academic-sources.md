presentation_description: >
  <p>Knowing how to start a research project and get to the end is challenging. Developing your academic voice can take years and is an area in which we can continually grow. In our academic writing, especially as we are just starting, it can be challenging to determine the best source to use.</p>
  <p>Robbins (2016) describes how social work students can find their academic voice through reading, practicing writing, and having the courage to receive feedback.</p>
