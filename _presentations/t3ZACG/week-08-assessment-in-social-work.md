      <blockquote>
      <p>Assessments give a social worker the ability to “gathering information and formulating it into a coherent picture of the client and his or her circumstances” (p. 187)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p>When we are thinking about assessments, we generally think about them as being multidimensional.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Complex Interplay</strong>: Human problems even those that appear to be simple at first glance—often involve a complex interplay of many factors.
      <ul>
      <li>Rarely do sources of problems reside solely within an individual or within that individual’s environment.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Complex Social Institutions</strong>: The multidimensionality of human problems is a consequence of the fact that human beings are social creatures who depend both on other human beings and on complex social institutions to meet their needs.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Person’s functioning</strong>: Assessing the functioning of an individual entails evaluating various aspects of that person’s functioning.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Although a social worker’s assessment will be guided by the setting in which the assessment is conducted, certain priorities in assessment influence all social work settings.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Initially, three questions should be assessed in all situations:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>What does the client see as his or her primary concerns or goals?</li>
      <li>What (if any) current or impending legal mandates must the client and social worker consider?</li>
      <li>What (if any) potentially serious health or safety concerns might require the social worker’s and client’s attention?</li>

      <strong>When</strong>: When do you experience the behavior?</li>

      <li>In the last month, how often have you been upset because of something that happened unexpectedly?</li>
      <li>In the last month, how often have you felt that you were unable to control the important things in your life?</li>
      <li>In the last month, how often have you felt nervous and stressed?</li>
      <li>In the last month, how often have you felt confident about your ability to handle your personal problems?</li>
      <li>In the last month, how often have you felt that things were going your way?</li>
      <li>In the last month, how often have you found that you could not cope with all the things that you had to do?</li>
      <li>In the last month, how often have you been able to control irritations in your life?</li>
      <li>In the last month, how often have you felt that you were on top of things?</li>
      <li>In the last month, how often have you been angered because of things that happened that were outside of your control?</li>

      <p>Score yourself</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ol>
      <li>Reverse your scores for questions 4, 5, 7, and 8. On these 4 questions, change the scores like this: 0 = 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1, 4 = 0.</li>
      <li>Add up your scores for each item to get a total.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Individual scores on the PSS can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress.</li>
      <li>Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress.</li>
      <li>Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Perceived Stress Scale is interesting and important because your perception of what is happening in your life is most important. Consider the idea that two individuals could have the exact same events and experiences in their lives for the past month. Depending on their perception, total score could put one of those individuals in the low stress category and the total score could put the second person in the high stress category</p>
      <p>[Small Group Activity] Students will be broken up into small groups to consider their scores for the Perceived Stress Screener</p>
      <ul>
      <li>How accurate was your do you feel this was</li>
      <li>How is completing a screener useful for the worker</li>
      <li>How is completing a screener useful for the client</li>
      </ul>
      <p>[Whole Class Activity] Have discussion about how we can use screeners and why we might use them.</p>

      <p>This assignment is going to be a part of participation in class for week 09. There is no other assignments either this week or next to have time to prepare for it.</p>
      <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: For students to be able to both increase knowledge around assessment and to facilitate learning for peers about what to examine in various assessments.</p>
      <p><strong>Task</strong>: Students will work in small groups to plan a presentation to take place during class on 10/19/20. Students will prepare a short five to 10 minute presentation to talk about what social workers should be looking for in various aspects of assessments. During class 10/12/20 students will be divided up into four groups. Each group will be assigned one of the following out of the textbook:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Suicide Risk Assessment (pp. 230-234)</li>
      <li>Assessing Aggression (pp. 236-237)</li>
      <li>Assessing Environmental Systems (pp. 237-241)</li>
      <li>Assessing Biophysical Functioning (pp. 218 - 224)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Students are to prepare to share information and have a discussion with classmates about their selected area. Students may choose to create a presentation that can be completed during class. The goal is to help classmates know how to assess for the given topic and have a group discussion about the topic.</p>
      <p><strong>Criterion for Success</strong>: Students will show they are prepared in class on week nine to facilitate both information about their topic and have discussion with their fellow students.</p>

      <p>Symptoms include <strong>physical</strong>, <strong>emotional</strong> and <strong>cognitive</strong> changes. When the symptoms combine as in depression, they work in unison to cause a further decline in the mental state of the patient.

presentation_description: >
  <p>Week’s eight and nine are both about how social workers conduct assessments. After we have started building relationship with our clients, and before we can really find ways to support them we have understand what the real problem is. We will be looking at how we do assessments. We will review examples of screening tools, the DSM-5, and mini mental status exams. As well we are going to spend time discussing documentation.</p>
