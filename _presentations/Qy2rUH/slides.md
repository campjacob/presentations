      <p>Positivistic Approach to <strong>Infidelity</strong></p>
      <p>Track the number of people who engage in infidelity and how often they stray.</p>
      <p>Conduct a survey and look patterns among different variables defined at the start.</p>
      <p>Interpretative Approach to <strong>Infidelity</strong></p>
      <p>Study the meaning attached to cheating and look for patterns and trends.</p>
      <p>Interview cheaters:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>What comprises “cheating”?</li>
      <li>Is it sex, or texting someone of the opposite sex?</li>
      <li>Is there a continuum?</li>
      <li>What meaning do we make from these behaviors?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Positivistic Approach to <strong>Prisons</strong></p>
      <p>Measure the conditions of federal prisons</p>
      <p>Identify variables to measure conditions, such as square feet per inmate, number of hours in isolation, housing conditions,…  etc.</p>
      <p>Interpretative Approach to <strong>Prisons</strong></p>
      <p>Explore the experience of prisoners and/or guards and administrators.</p>
      <p>Research participants would explain their experiences, and the researcher would assign meaning to them.  She might look for themes across interviews to interpret the experiences of multiple research participants.</p>
      <p>This is <strong>experience-near</strong> and <strong>in</strong> a context (prisons).</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>http://www.ipia.utah.edu/imps/html/research.html</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Interpretive methods</strong> focus on the meaning-making practices of human actors.  Rather than trying to define reality, interpretive methods explore how we make meaning, or interpret reality.</p>
      <p>Called <strong>qualitative research</strong> in some disciplines, it is conducted from an “experience-near perspective” – the researcher does not start with concepts observed and measured with the senses.  Rather, she allows concepts to emerge from encounters in “the field.”</p>

      <p>Narrative: Explore the life on an individual</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Interviews and documents</li>
      <li>Typically one (sometimes more) person</li>
      <li>“Restorying,” developing themes, often use chronology</li>
      <li>Narrative about the stories of an individual’s life</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Phenomenology: Understand the essence of an experience</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Interviews, documents, observations</li>
      <li>Several individuals with the same lived experience</li>
      <li>Looking for significant statements, meaning units, describing the “essence”</li>
      <li>Description of the “essence” of an experience</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Grounded Theory: Develop a theory from data from the field</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Interviews</li>
      <li>Typically 20 to 60 individuals</li>
      <li>Coding, looking for themes, tying themes into a theory</li>
      <li>Generation of a theory illustrated in a figure</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ethnography: Describe and interpret a culture-sharing group</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Primarily observations  and interviews</li>
      <li>One culture-sharing group</li>
      <li>Deep description, identifying themes</li>
      <li>Description of how a culture-sharing group works</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Case Study: Provide an in-depth description of a case or group of cases</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Multiple sources (interview, observation, documents, etc.)</li>
      <li>Event, program, or activity</li>
      <li>Describing the case, identifying themes (cross-case themes)</li>
      <li>Detailed analysis of one or more cases</li>

      <p><strong>Participant Observation</strong>: The researcher observes participants in their natural environment, often times as a participant herself</p>
      <p><strong>In-depth Interview</strong>: The researcher asks several, open-ended questions to explore participants’ personal histories, experiences, and perspectives</p>
      <p><strong>Focus Group</strong>: The researcher asks in-depth questions of small groups of participants to explore their experiences, perspectives, and cultural norms</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Studies conducted in the “natural setting” of participants</li>
      <li>Variables cannot be controlled and experimentally manipulated</li>
      <li>The questions are not always completely defined when research begins</li>
      <li>Data collected are heavily influenced by the experiences and priorities of research participants (they participate in the process of research)</li>
      <li>Meanings are drawn from the data using processes that are natural/familiar (for example: observations and interviews rather than experiments)</li>
      </ul>

    slide_text: >
      <ul>
      <li>Researcher must be aware of her own biases and intentional about describing them</li>
      <li>Data collection is often collegiate, where research participants share their stories and the researcher is up-front about her understanding/interpretation</li>
      <li>Many studies depend upon multiple sources of data (different groups of participants) and multiple collection methods (interviews and observation, and analysis of documents).</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
      <p>The goal of an interpretive study is to identify relationships between the major themes that emerge from the data.  How do we do this?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Use diagraming  and other visual techniques to spatially sort themes according to how related they are</li>
      <li>Look for missing links</li>
      <li>Count the number of times a theme appears</li>
      <li>Note contradictory evidence</li>
      </ul>
