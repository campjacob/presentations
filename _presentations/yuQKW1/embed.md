Most weeks, students have opportunities to practice facilitating groups with their classmates or group activities they can take with them.
      Relationship to Other Sequences and Other Courses SOWK 487 is a practice class focused on teaching skills for effecting change in clients in groups and families.

First, starting with individuals, then SOWK 487 Theories of Practice II looks at working with groups. Finally, SOWK 488 looks at working with communities and a macro perspective.
