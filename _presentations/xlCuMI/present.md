      THINKING ERRORS AKA: COGNITIVE DISTORTIONS THINKING ERRORS OR COGNITIVE DISTORTIONS LEAD US TO TROUBLE WHEN WE USE THEM TO MAKE SENSE OF OUR POOR CHOICES AND ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR. WE ALSO END UP WITH CONSEQUENCES THAT WE DO NOT LIKE. Self-centered Thinking: Thinking about only your own needs or interests, not caring about others. One example is saying “If I lie to people, it is nobody’s business but mine.” Assuming the Worst: Acting as if the worst outcome in a situation is the only possible outcome. Thinking people are out to get you. One example is saying, “I might as well lie, people won’t believe me if I tell the truth.” Blaming Others: Not accepting responsibility for your choices and consequences. Making it seem like someone forced you to act how you did. Saying someone else is responsible. One example is saying, “People make me lie when they ask too many questions.” Minimizing/mislabeling: Thinking Errors or Cognitive Distortions lead us to trouble when we use them to make sense of our poor choices and antisocial behavior. We also end up with consequences that we do not like.
