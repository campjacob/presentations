      • Client self-monitoring Collateral information Tests or assessment instruments
      • Personal experiences of the social worker based on direct client interactions
      What are the advantages and limitations of each of the sources of information for assessment? What sources are typically used in their eld settings? What other information sources would be useful? Why are useful sources not used? Jacob Campbell, Ph.d. LICSW

      <p>Perceived Stress Scale
      (Cohen et al., 1983)
      Scoring Yourself</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Reverse your scores for questions 4, 5, 7, and 8. On these 4 questions, change the scores like this: 0 = 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1, 4 = 0. 2. Add up your scores for each item to get a total.
      Individual scores on the PSS can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress. Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress. Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress.
      The Perceived Stress Scale is interesting and important because your perception of what is happening in your life is most important. Consider the idea that two individuals could have the exact same events and experiences in their lives for the past month. Depending on their perception, total score could put one of those individuals in the low stress category and the total score could put the second person in the high stress category Jacob Campbell, Ph.d.
