And how satisfied are you with the timeliness of services provided?'- **Leading Questions**  - *Description:* Leading items introduce bias and can influence responses. Ensure earlier questions do not affect later answers.  - *Example:* 'How helpful was our highly trained and compassionate staff in addressing your needs?'  - *Revision:* 'How would you rate the staff’s ability to address your needs?'- **Inadequate Response Options**  - *Description:* An inadequate range of response options may force inaccurate answers or cause respondent frustration and dropout.  - *Example:* 'How many years have you been a client? [ ] 1 year [ ] More than 10 years'  - *Revision:* 'How many years have you been a client? [ ] Less than 1 year [ ] 2-3 years [ ] 4-7 years"
