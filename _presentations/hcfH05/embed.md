      <p>􀠎
      OBSERVATION YOUR CONVERSATIONS THIS WEEK A. As you interact with others and observe others’ interactions during the week, notice how frequently infrequently people send empathic messages. Also, observe the types of messages that are sent and how these messages influence the course of conversations. B. As you interact with your spouse, parents, children, friends, and fellow students, practice listening carefully and responding with empathic messages when appropriate. Be alert to how empathic messages influence interactions and to the feeling tones that these responses create. Fall 2023 SOWK 486w

      <p>PRACTICE WITH EMPATHIC COMMUNICATION •
      Single woman, age 80 [to social worker concerning her request to move to an independent living complex provided for ambulatory older persons]:
      •
      Goodness, the more I think of moving, the more scared I get. I have neighbors here who look after me, and I won’t know a soul there. I’m afraid I’ll be all alone.

      Male, age 16 [in weekly visit to social work probation officer]:
      •
      I don’t see the sense in having to come here every (expletive) week. I haven’t been in any trouble now since I went to court a month ago. You should know by now you can trust me.”

      <p>Work in teams of three or four to design a planned intervention for teaching empathy. What population would you work with, how would you teach them empathy, what would some of the sessions look like? You will have about 15 minutes to come up with ideas, and then you will share back with the group.</p>

      <p>ROLE PLAY SESSION 1 You are a freshman college student. You went to a student health clinic because you were having difficulty sleeping and were experiencing anxiety. They have referred you to the counseling clinic for an assessment. You are anxious about this referral, wondering if it means that you are going crazy. You are homesick and miss the people back home. You sometimes wonder if you are ready for this. You have begun to drink with people in the dorm; it makes you feel less lonely.

      <p>ROLE PLAY SESSION 2
      Estrella (or Erik) was referred to a social worker at the battered women’s shelter by a friend. The friend urged her to come to get help because the friend felt that Estrella was being abused by her husband. Estrella feels conflicted because she acknowledges that there is some violence, but feels that marriage is sacred, that she should be loyal, and that things will just work out.
