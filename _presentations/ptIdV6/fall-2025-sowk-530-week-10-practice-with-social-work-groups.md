    slide_alt: "Object: Presentation slide  Action: Lists common mistakes  Context: Outlines errors related to sharing purpose by practitioners.Text:- 'Practitioners promote a group purpose without adequate consideration of client need.- Practitioners confuse group purpose with group content.- Practitioners state group purpose at such a high level of generality that it is vague and meaningless and, therefore, provides little direction for the group.- Practitioners are reluctant to share with the members their perceptions and ideas about the group’s purpose.- Practitioners function with a hidden purpose in mind that they do not share with the group.- Practitioners do not understand purpose as a dynamic, evolving concept that changes over the life of the group. Instead, they view Purpose as static and fixed.'At bottom:  'Fall 2025 SOWK 530' / '(Kurland & Salmon, 2006, p. 108)' / 'Jacob Campbell, Ph.D LICSW at Heritage University'"
