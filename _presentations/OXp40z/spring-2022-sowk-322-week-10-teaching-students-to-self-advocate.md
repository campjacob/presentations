  <p>In my lecture video, <a href="https://heritage.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=3ed9aa97-379b-4874-86ca-ae5e005e2900" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Week 10 - Teaching Students to Self-Advocate</a>, I talk about three different papers about this topic. First, <a href="https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=680e40a4-d016-495d-b9cc-effa2c7d679a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McCarthy (2017)</a> provides an example of self-advocacy and youth with disabilities through the example of an encounter with a student. Second, <a href="https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=680e40a4-d016-495d-b9cc-effa2c7d679a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Downing et al. (2007)</a> is a study that was helping to identify how to track self-advocacy.  Finally, <a href="https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=36761aaf-abf6-4f90-89d4-548b3462440a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martin et al. (1993)</a> is an older paper, but it describes what developing a transition plan is and how self-advocacy can fit throughout the K-12 experience for students. I’ve uploaded all of the articles and linked the above if you would like to read them.</p>
