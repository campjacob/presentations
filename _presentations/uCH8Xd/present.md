      Relationship to Other Sequences and Other Courses SOWK 486w is a practice class focused on teaching skills for effecting changes in individual clients. It is considered a ‚Äúw‚Äù class because it is writing-focused. During a student‚Äôs time in the social work program, there are three theories of practice courses. Each one focuses on a different level of interaction. First, this course starts with individuals, then SOWK 487 Theories of Practice II concentrates on working with groups. Finally, SOWK 488 looks at working with communities and a macro perspective.
