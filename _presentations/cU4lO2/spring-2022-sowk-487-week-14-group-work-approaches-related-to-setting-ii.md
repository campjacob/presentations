      <p>“THE PURPOSE OF GROUP WORK, REGARDLESS OF THE INTERVENTION AND THE PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE LEVELS OF THE PARTICIPANTS, IS TO ENABLE THE OLDER ADULT TO FUNCTION AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL POSSIBLE AND TO PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY, OR SOCIETY AT LARGE EXPECTS FROM A CERTAIN PERSON IN A CERTAIN SITUATION. GROUPS PROVIDE A CUSHION, A WAY TO SAFELY EXPLORE ONE’S OWN IDENTITY AND TO FORGE NEW CONNECTIONS WITH OTHERS” Campbell (2017) in Handbook of Social Work with Groups, p. 307 SOWK 487

  <p>Week 14 is getting close to the end of the semester. We will start class with a painting activity that I find can be useful in facilitating groups. The readings for this week include Córdova et al. (2017) write about substance abuse prevention groups. Next, I will present a TED talk <a href="https://youtu.be/PY9DcIMGxMs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong | Johann Hari</a>, and we will spend some time talking about the concept of addiction. Saunders (2017) is another of the week’s readings, and he talks about partner abuse groups. We will spend time in class practicing assertiveness skills and groups. Finally, we will go through an activity that I picked up while living on Campus at Eastern Washington University and as a part of the residential hall association.</p>
