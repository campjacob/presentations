      An Overview of the Americans with Disabilities Act The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), enacted in 1990, is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life, including jobs, schools, transportation, and all public and private places that are open to the general public. The ADA is divided into five titles (or sections) that relate to different areas of public life.
      Title I - Employment • Designed to help people with disabilities access the same employment opportunities and benefits available to people without disabilities. • Applies to employers with 15 or more employees.
      Read Chapter 3 The Disability Rights Movement in the United States
      • Requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified applicants or employees. A “reasonable accommodation” is a change that does not cause the employer “undue hardship” (too much difficulty or expense). • Defines disability, establishes guidelines for the reasonable accommodation process, addresses medical examinations and inquiries, and defines “direct threat” when there is risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual employee with a disability or others. • Regulated and enforced by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/disability.cfm
      Title II - Public Services: State and Local Government •
      Prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by “public entities,” which are programs, services and activities operated by state and local governments.
      •
      Requires public entities (programs, services and activities operated by state and local governments) to be accessible to individuals with disabilities.

      • Outlines requirements for self-evaluation and planning; making reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and procedures where necessary to avoid discrimination; identifying architectural barriers; and communicating effectively with people with hearing, vision and speech disabilities. • Regulated and enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice. http://www.ada.gov
      Title III - Public Accommodations and Services Operated by Private Entities • Prohibits places of public accommodation from discriminating against individuals with disabilities. Public accommodations include privately-owned, leased or operated facilities like hotels, restaurants, retail merchants, doctors’ offices, golf courses, private schools, sports stadiums, theaters, and so on. • Sets the minimum standards for accessibility for alterations, new construction and barrier removal. www.adata.org

      <p>A service not a place…
      • Special education is not a classroom, it is a continuum of services • Special education is de ined by the type of instruction the student gets, not where the instruction occurs • Special education is specially designed instruction which is de ined as:
      a change in the teaching strategies and methods used in order to di erentiate material for students

      <p>Important Terms in Special Education • Free and Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) A program designed to meet the individual needs of the student at no cost to the family. • Specially Designed Instruction (SDI) Organized and planned instructional activities, which adapt, as appropriate, the content, methodology, or delivery of instruction, in order to address the unique needs that result from a student’s disability.
