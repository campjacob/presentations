      Areas to Consider Ethics in Professional Writing
      Ethics and Social Welfare, 2015 http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17496535.2015.1009481
      Social workers write a lot and their writing has a major impact on people’s lives. The complexity of their writing task arises because they must deal with confidential client information while usually writing for multiple audiences. This means that social work students must achieve more than the basics of technical writing skills. The purpose of this article is twofold. First, after reviewing the literature on the importance and challenges of writing well in social work (and having hosted a number of writing workshops for social workers and human services practitioners), we argue that the development of students’ writing skills must be framed within the social, political and ethical professional circumstances in which students will be working in the future. By teaching writing skills through the lens of the profession’s ethics and values, students will be instilled with a greater understanding of the importance of writing. Second, we propose a model of ethical professional writing which integrates three essential elements that must conjoin in tandem: reflective mindfulness of the client-centred focus of writing responsibilities; a sound understanding of the values and principles of the social work and human services professions as highlighted in the unifying themes in various codes of ethics; and competence in compositional, rhetorical and technical writing skills. In particular, this article focuses on the second element of this model which is concerned with having a sound understanding of the values and principles of ethical professional writing. We conclude that this framework will promote writing competence and benefit clients. Keywords: Ethical professional writing; client-centred writing; writing values and principles

      Completeness
      fi
      Developed
      Highly Developed The plan is thorough and covers the entire research project.
      Clarity
      The plan clearly articulates both the evaluation design and data collection that will take place within the research. The evaluation design includes components, indicators, sources, and what success looks like. The data collection identi es speci c tasks, the person responsible, and deadlines for completing those tasks.
      Fairness
      Group members are fairly distributed with tasks related to the assignment.
      Feasibility
      The program evaluation plan appears feasible and something the group can accomplish within the semester.

  <p>Continuing the discussion of program evaluation and ethics and how to write ethical frameworks is the focus of week four. We will examine ethical considerations and frameworks with program evaluation. Groups will also have time to consider their planned evaluation and develop their group work plans.</p>
  <p>The agenda for this week includes the following:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>What is an ethical framework</li>
  <li>Ways we consider ethics within program evaluation</li>
  <li>How we would write about ethical frameworks</li>
  <li>Planning the design of and tasks completion of your evaluation</li>
  </ul>
