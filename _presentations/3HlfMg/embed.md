      <blockquote>
      <p>We do evaluations because we must continually try to improve our professional skills and knowledge.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>To <strong>increase your own effectiveness</strong> as a worker requires feedback from others.</li>
      <li>We want to <strong>know how client systems experienced their work with us</strong> which gives them a chance to be heard (empowerment).</li>
      <li>Helps <strong>build the knowledge base of the profession</strong>.</li>

      <blockquote>
      <p>During the last 25 years the funding for social programs have become scarce and the demands for evaluation has increased. This increases accountability from social programs. Accountability in social work involves being responsible for and answerable to others for the quality and effectiveness of one’s efforts.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p>There are different things that could get in the way of evaluation:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Time consuming</li>
      <li>Clinician vulnerability (judgments)</li>
      <li>Lack of a routine system (not something done frequently)</li>
      <li>Insufficient effort focused on evaluation from agencies</li>
      <li>Deficient skills and training regarding use of evaluation approaches</li>
      </ul>

      <ol>
      <li>Effort (Monitor ongoing operation)</li>
      <li>Effects (Assess the outcomes)</li>
      <li>Effectiveness (Succeeding at what you set out to accomplish)</li>
      <li>Efficiency (Doing it at a reasonable cost)</li>

      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Engagement</strong>: Define the problem to be evaluated</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Planning</strong>: Consider the type of research approach that might be appropriate</li>

      <p>There are a number of types of evaluations…</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Formative Evaluations</strong>: assess the adequacy or amount of effort directed at solving a client systems problem and gathering data during the actual intervention (i.e. teacher evaluations).</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Summarative Evaluations</strong>: an evaluation that takes place after completing the planned change process (i.e. end of semester examinations).</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Baseline</strong>: is a measure of the frequency, intensity, or duration of a behavior.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There are a number of terms that are associated with evaluation.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Validity</strong>-the extent to which you are measuring what you think you are measuring.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Face validity</strong>-professional judgment about whether the measure actually measure what it is supposed to.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Concurrent validity</strong> exists when scores on one instrument correlate well with scores on another instrument that is already considered valid.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Predictive validity</strong>-when it can be used to predict future events.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Reliability</strong>-is the extent to which an instrument measures the same phenomenon in the same way each time the measure is used.  Reliable instruments produce consistent results over time.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Data</strong>: Gathering Methods-commonly used methods include surveys, scores of instruments, interviews with significant others, collected data, surveys or interviews, self reports, products which is achievement of a specific task or change in behavior, or observational measures these rely on others to observe a change in the clients behavior.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Independent Variable</strong>: is the factor we think is responsible for causing certain behaviors, reactions or events.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Dependent Variable</strong>: is the outcome or end product of the helping process.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Generalizability</strong>: is the ability of a set of results in one situation to fit another circumstance or instance.
      <ul>
      <li>Generalization across the globe have resulted in numerous failures of practice and policy both in the US and across the globe.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Single-Subject Designs are research methods aimed at determining whether or not an intervention was successful.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Often used with a single case or client.</li>
      <li>Is a method used when achievement of the goal is sufficiently important to be used as the primary outcome criterion.  This focus on the desired state and not the problem.</li>
      <li>A / B data points</li>

      <p>There are other forms of single system design studies that we can do.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Goal Attainment Scaling</strong> is a method used when achievement of the goal is sufficiently important to be used as the primary outcome criterion.  This focus on the desired state and not the problem.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Task achievement scaling</strong> is a method of evaluating the degree to which an identified set of tasks has been accomplished.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Client satisfaction</strong> questionnaires are a series of questions designed to learn the reactions of the customer to various aspects of the products.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Target problem scaling</strong> is a process where a problem is identified , a plan is implemented, and changes in target problems are measured to determine if the problem has changed in severity.</li>

      <p>PEER-EBD
      Participatory Evaluation and Expert Review for Classrooms Serving Students with EBD</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>The PEER-EBD is a program evaluation that our school district participates in. It is an interesting means for evaluating a program.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p>It is researched based, reviewing 18 different areas which are indicators of evidence-based practices in four categories (Systems &amp; Philosophy,Structure, Individual Programming: Builds Academic and Behavioral Competence, Climate &amp; Group Process). The questionnaire is quite lengthy to complete.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p>There are three parts:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ol>
      <li>Expert review (completed through observation, interviews, reviewing artifacts)</li>
      <li>Individual surveys</li>

      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Lack of generalizability</strong>: One successful program may not necessarily be general to implement with other groups. Interventions that are effective for one client may not work as well for others.</li>
      <li>Wrong <strong>choice of evaluation tools</strong>.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Ethical considerations</strong>: It is important to always involve clients in the evaluation process.  Doing research on clients without informing them is ethically wrong.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>No Buy in</strong>: Staff distrust of evaluation, they may feel they are being criticized or condemned.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Difficulty</strong>: Clients may find the process overly time-consuming or intrusive.</li>

      <li>Decide <strong>when to terminate</strong> the professional worker-client relationship.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Evaluate achievement</strong> of the objectives.</li>

      <p>Whenever possible the worker should plan for termination and involve the client in the process.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>There may be different reactions and feelings when it comes time for termination on behalf the client and the worker.</li>
      <li>A way to help a client at termination is planning for it, address feelings about it, and summarize progress.</li>
      <li>Stabilization of change examples</li>

      <p>There is sufficient evidence that changes that occur in the context of therapeutic relationships do not necessarily carry over into other areas of client examples… we need to look for ways to make it more generalizable.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Helping clients select <strong>relevant and appropriate situations</strong> to work on (client driven, addressing reason for coming in…)</li>
      <li>Helping clients <strong>build confidence</strong> in their own abilities (Strengths perspective, reviewing progress)</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Using multiple situations and settings</strong> when helping members learn new behaviors (addressing at home, work, school, practice examples)</li>
      <li>Using <strong>naturally occurring consequences</strong> rather than artificial ones (going out and doing it in real life vs. just with clinician)</li>
      <li>Extending treatment through <strong>use of follow up</strong> (Looking past the end of the services to monitor and follow up)</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Reducing setbacks in other environments</strong> (Getting outside supports involved, making environmental changes)</li>
      <li>Helping members confront future problems by <strong>teaching problem solving process</strong> (teach a man to fish… etc)</li>
