      <h2>Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn</h2>
      <p>Week four of SOWK 486 is about understanding what direct social work practice and some of what makes social workers unique in our helping style. We will start with an exercise, considering how you have been helped in the past.  Many clients we work with as social workers a mandated to participate in services and involuntary in some manner. We will discuss how to engage with them through some best practices. The agenda for the session is as follows:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>How we help</li>
      <li>Evidence-based practice</li>
      <li>Involuntary clients</li>
      <li>Ecological Systems Model</li>
      <li>Social work jobs and roles</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Unit Resources</h2>
      <p>In your ethics class, you will likely read the entire code of ethics, but it is useful to read through it and familiarize yourself with the values and expectations of being a social worker. You can find it online <a href="https://www.socialworkers.org/about/ethics/code-of-ethics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics</a>.</p>
      <p>I post all of the presentations online at <a href="https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presentations.jacobrcampbell.com</a>. You can find the presentation for <a href="----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Week 04: Direct Social Work Practice</a></p>

      <h2>Unit Assignments</h2>
      <p>This week the following are your assignments for you to complete the reading quiz for chapters one and two. These are to be completed before class on Monday and can be found in the assignments. Feel free to work in groups or go at your own pace. The answers/results of the quiz will be released on Monday after the class has started. Feel free to ask about the quiz if you questions.</p>
      <p>For your asynchronous class engagement, you have a discussion forum that you will be completing.</p>
      <p><strong>Meta</strong>: Students will complete an initial forum post by Friday 09/18/20 at 11:55 PM and at least two replies to your fellow students by Sunday 09/20/20 at 11:55 PM.</p>
      <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The purpose of this forum discussion questions is to have students self-reflect regarding the core values of the social workers and their own lives.</p>
      <p><strong>Task</strong>: During class this week, I will share the six core values of social workers described in the preamble of the NASW Code of Ethics and related to my values. These include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Service</strong>: Social workers’ primary goal is to help people in need and to address social problems.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Social Justice</strong>: Social workers challenge social injustice.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Dignity and Worth of the Person</strong>: Social workers respect the inherent dignity and worth of the person.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Importance of Human Relationships</strong>: Social workers recognize the central importance of human relationships.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Integrity</strong>: Social workers behave in a trustworthy manner.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Competence</strong>: Social workers practice within their areas of competence and develop and enhance their professional expertise.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Students are to discuss at least two of the values and discuss how they relate to their life and how they connect with it. They will then offer comments and engage in discussions with at least two of their fellow students.</p>
      <p><strong>Criteria for Success</strong>: Students will be able to write reflectively, giving readers insight into how they relate and connect with social work’s core values. They will comment and discuss with at least to of their fellow students.</p>

      <p>In the preamble section, the NASW <em>Code of Ethics</em> gives six different values.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ol>
      <li>
      <strong>Service</strong>: I think about this we as social workers have to get our jeans a little bit dirty. (The provision of help, resources, and benefits so that people may achieve their maximum potential.)</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Social Justice</strong>: I think about social justice in regards to getting out and helping “stop the babies” from flowing down the river. (The idea that in a perfect world all citizens would have “the same basic rights, protection, and opportunities, obligations, and social benefits.”)</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Dignity and worth of the person</strong>: I’m reminded of reading <em>Under the Overpass: A Journey of Faith on the Streets of America</em> by Mike Yankoski… and his discussion of just even looking at people who are homeless. (Holding people in high esteem and appreciating individual value)</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Importance of human relationships</strong>: Building rapport with our clients, colleagues, for me people all around the world. (Valuing the “mutual emotional exchange; dynamic interaction ; and affective, cognitive and behavioral connections… which creates atmosphere”)</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Integrity</strong>: After graduating from the Master’s Commission, my pastor gave me a compass that I keep on my desk as a reminder to follow what’s right (trustworthiness and sound adherence to moral ideals)</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Competence</strong>: Constantly growing, improving… think dryfous model of skill acquisition. (Necessary skills and abilities)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>[Discussion] Why is social work research important.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Social workers must be able to evaluate effectively the work they do with clients at all levels. The evaluation of macro system effectiveness, and the ability to understand, analyze, and critically evaluate social literature and research.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Why Knowledge about social work research is important</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Choosing effective interventions
      <ul>
      <li>Scientific orientation to identify, evaluate, and choose effective interventions</li>
      <li>Research-informed practice is evidence-based social work</li>
      <li>Framing social work interventions so they can be evaluated through research thus providing information about which specific techniques work best for specific problems.</li>
      <li>Practice-informed research refers to scientific investigation designed to attain results related to successful social work practice.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>More effective individual practice
      <ul>
      <li>The second reason research is important is because with this scientific perspective, it can guide social workers to become more effective in their practice.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Development of profession
      <ul>
      <li>The third reason is that accumulated research helps to build an effective knowledge base for the social work profession.</li>
      <li>This helps define social work practice, increase the effectiveness of interventions, and enhance the professions accountability.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>

      <p>The most standard, but also the hardest way to complete practice is through what Rubin (2007) describes as the Process Model.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p>“A form of evidence-based practice in which the individual practitioner formulates a question about his or her work with a client that is answerable with data, consults the appropriate empirical literature, assesses the evidence, shares it with the client, makes an informed collaborative decision, implements the intervention, and assesses its effectiveness.” (Hepworth, et al., 2017)</p>

      <p>In working with clients, taking a more eclectic approach is sometimes the method. This is especially true with increased use of training in EBP’s…</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Common Elements Approach</strong>: In evidence-based practice, examining commonalities across effective interventions (Chorpita, Daleiden, &amp; Weisz, 2005).</p>
      <p><strong>Common Factors Approach</strong>: In evidence-based practice, emphasizing broad factors shared by different intervention approaches, such as strength of relationship or alliance (Duncan, Miller, Wampold, &amp; Hubble, 2010).</p>

      <p>Deciding when and how to intervene with our clients is a vital skill that social workers must learn. The following are some of the criteria that we must consider:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Increase decision making</strong>: Social workers value maximum feasible self-determination, empowerment, and enhancing of strengths to increase the client’s voice in decision making.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Assess</strong>: Social workers assess circumstances from a systems perspective, mindful of the person in the situation, the setting, the community, and the organization.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Sensitive to diversity</strong>: Social workers are sensitive to diversity in considering interventions.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Evidence based practices</strong>: Social workers draw on evidence-based practices at both process and intervention levels as well as common factors in determining, together with the client, how to proceed.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Critical thinking</strong>: Social workers think critically about practice, checking out assumptions and examining alternatives.</li>
