      ntrospection indfulness
      You must acknowledge that implicit bias exists and then learn about your own implicit bias Stress increases our use of cognitive shortcuts, including implicit biases
      erspective Taking
      earn to Slow Down ndividuation
      Try to walk in someone else’s shoes by considering experiences from the perspective of a person from stereotyped groups
      To recognize our own implicit biases, we must stop, think, and re ect.
      Use individual personal characteristics, not group stereotypes, to evaluate clients.
      heck Your Messaging
      nstitutionalize Fairness take Two
      Instead of trying to be color- or gender-blind, use evidence-based statements that decrease implicit bias such as welcoming and embracing multiculturalism and gender diversity.
      Organizations must also commit and work to overcome it
      Counteracting implicit bias and working toward cultural humility is lifelong work and must be practiced consistently and constantly
