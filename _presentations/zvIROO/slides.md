Authored by Jacob Campbell, Ph.D., LICSW, Heritage University. Text excerpt: 'Cultural comfort refers to the way practitioners who approach their work with cultural humility can engage with cultural opportunities to deepen their understanding of another person’s cultural identity through meaningful conversation and self-reflection. When moments of cultural discomfort arise, they offer valuable chances to learn more about our own assumptions and perspectives, as well as to gain a deeper understanding of others.'"
