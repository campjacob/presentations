      </li>
      <li>Identify and address risk: Risks should be documented and explicitly discussed as well as planned to help mitigate. Think process for IRB.</li>
      <li>Cultivate mutual responsibility: between parties involved in the development/implementation of the program evaluation</li>
      <li>Incorporate scrutiny: Work with stakeholders, for blindspots</li>
      <li>Understand the setting: Unable to understand the risk to the population unless understand the setting and population</li>
      <li>Avoid deception: Openness and transparency</li>

      <p>Implicit bias refers to attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner.
      EVERYone has implicit bias.
      Having implicit bias does not make you a bad evaluator. Failing to recognize and consciously challenge your implicit bias can contribute to bad evaluations.</p>

      <li>Have we constructed a sample or scope of study that is inclusive of diverse people served?</li>
      <li>How have we addressed language and literacy to assure accuracy and inclusiveness in our study?</li>
      <li>What  material resources have we identified and reviewed to education ourselves about the agency and the persons served?</li>
      <li>Are there actions or steps that we can take to increase the sense of comfort or safety for evaluation participants?</li>
      <li>Have we identified key descriptors and outcomes in an accurate manner that avoids negative stereotypes and includes program and participate strengths?</li>
      <li>Have we inquired about demographic and culturally related information for participants to identify factors that help understand their experiences?</li>
      <li>Are there specific ways that we can sensitively convey respect for people’s efforts and time commitment while they are participating in the study?</li>
      <li>Have we been sufficiently sensitive to potential stigma or vulnerabilities experienced by evaluation participants?</li>
      <li>In what ways have we been attentive to confidentiality at each stage of the evaluation?</li>
      <li>Are there ways in which the study process and findings can actually provide benefits to the present or future recipients of services?</li>
      <li>Have we discovered information that can and should inform advocacy efforts?</li>
