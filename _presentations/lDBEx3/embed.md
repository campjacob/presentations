      <p>[Discussion] What is the difference between a perspective and a theory</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Theory</strong>: A general statement about the real world whose essential truth can be supported by evidence obtained through the scientific method.
      <ul>
      <li>Must explain in a provable way why something happens.</li>
      <li>Ex: Learning theory explains behavior on the basis of what organisms have learned from the environment.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Perspective</strong>: A way of perceiving the world flows from a value position.
      * The perspective will influence choice of theory and model.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Framework / Model</strong>: Is a blueprint for action. It describes what happens in practice in a general way.</li>
      <li>Examples of theories and perspectives
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Theories</strong>: System theory, psychodynamic theory, social learning theory, conflict theory, Erikson’s theory of stages of development, Piaget’s theory of cognition… etc</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Perspectives</strong>: Strengths perspective, ecological perspective, feminist perspective… etc.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Frameworks / Models</strong>: Solution–focused, cognitive-behavioral, task-centered, narrative, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <li>
      <strong>Person-in-environment</strong>: A focuses on people constantly interacting with various systems around them. So the social workers focused improving the interactions between the person and systems.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Interface</strong>: the exact point at which the interaction between an individual and the environment</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Transactions</strong>: people communicate and interact with those in their environments [can be positive or negative]</li>

      <strong>Energy</strong>: the natural power of active involvement among people and their environments takes place [input or output]</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Adaptation</strong>: the capacity to adjust to surrounding environmental conditions. This implies change because a person must adapt to change in order to continue functioning in their environment.  Social workers help individuals during this process to direct their energies so that they are able to adapt</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Coping</strong>: a form of human adaptation and implies a struggle to overcome problems.  Refers to the way we deal with the problems we experience.</li>
