      WRITING THE INTRODUCTION BRIEF DESCRIPTION/DEFINITION/OVERVIEW OF TOPIC Domestic violence refers to any aggressive behavior within the home or between people who reside together. While many people imagine domestic violence as occurring between romantic partners (such as married or cohabitating couples), it can also involve other family members, such as parents and their children.

      WRITING THE INTRODUCTION E X P L A N AT I O N O F P R E V A L E N C E / I M PA C T N AT I O N A L LY, S TAT E W I D E , A N D L O C A L LY Each year, approximately 4.8 million women and 2.9 million men are victims of intimate partner violence (CDC, 2016). Washington State numbers parallel these trends, with 1 in 10 Washingtonians reporting having been a victim of or witness to domestic violence in the past year (Washington State Department of Health, n.d.). In Yakima County, injuries from domestic violence are the third most common reason 18-24 year old women visit the ER (Schillreff, 2017).

      WRITING THE INTRODUCTION S TAT E M E N T O F S I G N I F I C A N C E T H AT A N S W E R S THE QUESTION, WHY SHOULD THE READER CARE? Domestic violence leaves many scars and can cost society greatly. In Yakima County, the costs associated with ER visits alone total over $3 million dollars a year (Schillreff, 2017). However, very little is known about what interventions are most successful with Latino families in our area. This study hopes to fill that knowledge gap.

      EXPLAIN HOW BIG THE P R O B L E M I S U S I N G S TAT I S T I C S EXAMPLE BY JULIE SCHILLREFF Native American students in the United States have the lowest six-year completion rate (41%) of any US ethnic group (NCES, 2016e) and are the least likely to earn a bachelor’s degree in their lifetime (NCES, 2016a). However, Native students in Washington State are out-performing their national peers in terms of college completion. At public universities, for example, 29% of Native students graduate in four years and 53% graduate within six years. At Heritage University, however, the six-year completion rate for Native American students (0%) falls well below state (45%) and national (48%) averages for this population (Chronicle of Higher Education, nd).

      SIGNIFICANCE THIS STUDY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE… This study is significant because it has the potential to increase completion rates among Native American students of Heritage University. Heritage students represent the New Majority—low-income, first generation, Native American and Latino college students—and while they arrive with dreams of completing a degree, most fail to do so. By helping us better understand what factors contribute to Native American retention, we can ensure that more Native American student earn degrees.

      Recently, the F.B.I. and other local government agencies have become particularly watchful of international criminal organizations, which drew their origins from domestic street gangs. Two, in particular, have expanded their status toward that of transnational criminal organizations. They are the Eighteenth Street gang (Calle Dieciocho) and the Mara Salvatrucha gang. Both are originally from Los Angeles, California, an area most commonly known as the Pico-Union area. But today, “cliques” (subsets of member gangs) can now be found anywhere between the U.S., Mexico, and Central America (Vigil, 1998, p.92). This expansion has resulted, predominantly because of immigrant deportation, but also due to the gangs’ recruitment policies and drug smuggling activities. The sudden growth of these local street gangs into global networks continues to undermine authorities as to their power and most importantly, the infrastructure within the gangs. The consequences which may result from this power growth lie anywhere between an increase of narcotics trafficking, to the creation of another global terrorist threat. In order to decipher future consequences of these gangs, further analysis must be made as to how they once began.

  <p>This session is all about how do you choose a research topic and how do you write an introduction. It gives steps and ideas specifically for writing an introduction. The agenda is:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Getting started with research methods and ideas for writing</li>
  <li>How to determine our research topic</li>
  <li>Steps in writing an introduction</li>
  <li>Using a rubric to assess the introduction</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In thinking about how we decide on a research project and talking about Mind Mapping as an option for doing that I created a video on my YouTube channel about <a href="https://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2019/08/choosing-a-research-topic-criteria-for-choosing-and-a-digital-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Choosing a Research Topic - Criteria for Choosing and a Digital Tool</a>.
