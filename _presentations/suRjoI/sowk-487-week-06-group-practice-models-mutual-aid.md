presentation_description: >
  <p>During weeks six and seven, we bring our focus back to therapeutic group models. First, this week we will look at the less structured mutual aid groups, and next week we will be looking into cognitive-behavioral group work. We will be examining what mutual aid groups are used for, the phases of helping that happen with mutual aid, facilitation of these groups.</p>
