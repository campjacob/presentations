      <blockquote>
      <p>We are going to be talking about risk and protective factors later today. I wanted to start with an activity to see how they interact.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Obtain volunteers for each protective factor
      <ul>
      <li>Adolescent, parent, grandparent, coach, minister, friend</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Have formed a circle of protection around the adolescent joining hands</li>
      <li>Obtain volunteers for risk factors
      <ul>
      <li>convenience store operator, other friend, brother, school board president</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Instruct people representing risk factors to try to “get to” our adolescents through the circle of protection without causing any bodily injury. After a minute or so, help participants debrief what they saw or heard happening.</li>
      <li>___________ is pretty well protective here. We could form a group of parents to tell the convenience store operators they’ve had enough and will not allow the sale of alcohol to minors. They will picket the store, etc.</li>
      <li>Bring the person into circle too</li>
      <li>Feedback</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The reading this week reviewed three different approaches for group work related to purpose. These were:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Self-Help and Support Groups</strong>: Very related to the conversation we had regarding mutual aid groups and those concepts.
      <strong>Psychoeducation Groups</strong>: groups which are trying to either provide education, skill acquisition, and or self-knowledge.
      <strong>Prevention Groups</strong>: applying prevention concepts to a wide range of problems.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Today I want to spend time talking some about out prevention groups and psycho educational groups.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
      <p>Psychoeducational groups necessarily place social workers in the role of a teacher. This role, and by extension the deliver of information should not be imagined as  one way relationship.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Brown 2003 suggests that there are basic principals to deliver effective psychoeducaitonal groups:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Selecting optimum methods for delivering information based on participant factors (e.g., age, previous learning, motivation)</li>
      <li>Demonstrating the meaningfulness of material among group members</li>
      <li>Creating opportunities for group members to integrate new information with existing knowledge and skills;</li>
      <li>Encouraging retention of new information by doing</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
      <p>Engaging in group work practice requires some familiarity with styles of leadership conducive to facilitating psychoeducational groups.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Education on preparing and delivering</strong>: Education and/or training on preparing and delivering psychoeducational groups</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Knowledge of Group Process</strong>: Knowledge of group processes, including common stages of group development</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Supervision</strong>: Purposeful and targeted supervision related to group practices</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Interpersonal practice skills</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Capacity to self-reflect</strong> and challenge personal axes of privilege, power, and oppression</li>
      <li>Normalizing without essentializing</li>
      <li>Connection of group content to the anticipated stage of group development</li>

      <blockquote>
      <p>We can think of two basic types of psychoeducational groups. Those that are manualized and those that are responsive.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>The current trend is towards the integration of both types (i.e. manualized curricula with the flexibility to and awareness of groups processes)</li>

      <p>The public health framework is a method for creating change at various levels using the following key ideas:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>[Whole Class Activity] For each key idea, relate it to PDC and coalition work.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Defining the target</strong>: A clearly identified area of focus.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Understanding Risk and Protection</strong>: Through research-based knowledge finding corollary or casual finding how things relate to the target. Risks are the factors that are those things which play causal role that has a perceived negatively where protective factors are those ones that are perceived as positive.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Interrupting Risk and Building Protection</strong>: Develop interventions designed to interrupt risk processes or promoting protective processes.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Assessing the Effectiveness of Prevention</strong>: Assess level of change.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Prevention groups can chose to either do universal prevention or they can do selective prevention.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Universal is focused on things provided to everybody.
      Selective is where a group is specifically targeted.</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>Selective practice can be related to some of the following considerations:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>[Whole Class Activity] Elicit examples of each.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Person-Environment Fit</strong>: groups using a cognitive behavioral approach to improve a person in the environment fit (i.e. group addressing beliefs about condom use and how to get a partner to use)
      <ul>
      <li>Focus on individual change or group change</li>
      <li>Can be skill-building (role play)</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Human Development</strong>: Interventions should be built on research-based knowledge of human development.
      <ul>
      <li>Built on needs that are presented</li>
      <li>Reviews developmental transitions
      <strong>Culturally Competent Practice</strong>: Cultural Humility
      Can also have indicated services, which are focused on needs that have been demonstrated or require a higher level of support. These indicated needs are often performed by an outside professional or persons with more specific training.</li>

presentation_description: >
  <p>Week eight focused on three types of groups and relating them to the task they are attempting to address. In this week’s readings, Kurtz (2017) discusses support and self-help groups, Root (2017) explains some of the considerations around psychoeducational groups, and Marshiglia and Kiehne (2017) dive into an example of prevention groups. The agenda for class today includes the following:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Psychoeducational groups</li>
  <li>Public Health Framework</li>
  <li>Other prevention frameworks and models</li>
  <li>Designing a school-based intervention</li>
  </ul>
