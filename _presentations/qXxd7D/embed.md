      <p>How we manage and deal with verbal and non verbal behavior has a lot to do with how we are able to communicate <br> [Discussion] Who has seen Lie to Me?</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Human interaction and communication involve both verbal and nonverbal behavior.</li>
      <li>Verbal behavior is what is being said.</li>
      <li>Non verbal behavior is communication in ways other than spoken words.</li>
      <li>People communicate by…
      <ul>
      <li>Facial expressions</li>
      <li>Hand movements</li>
      <li>Eye contact</li>
      <li>Sitting position</li>
      <li>Proximity</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Any aspect of a person’s presence that conveys ideas or information without being spoken is nonverbal communication.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
      <p>Any aspect of a person’s presence that conveys ideas or information without being spoken is nonverbal communication. In communication in general, there are six basic parts of communication:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ol>
      <li>Attentive listening</li>
      <li>Eye contact</li>
      <li>Facial expressions</li>
      <li>Body positioning</li>
      <li>Paraverbal</li>
      <li>Verbal</li>
      </ol>
      <blockquote>
      <p>As we think about these verbal and non verbal aspects, we should also be thinking about this threefold task:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>(1) to assess your repetitive nonverbal behaviors
      (2) to eliminate nonverbal styles that hinder effective communication
      (3) to sustain and perhaps increase desirable nonverbal behaviors</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>The opposite of talking isn’t listening. The opposite of talking is waiting.
      ~ Fran Lebowitz</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Attentive listening implies more than just audio reception of the words that are said.  It focuses on comprehending  the meaning of what is said. This can be called physical attending.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It takes really focusing on the person that you are talking to.</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>We don’t want to have no eye contact and we don’t want to have constant eye contact. We want to have moderate eye contact, which is somewhere in between no eye contact and constant eye contact.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Not extremes…</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>No Eye Contact</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Constant Eye Contact</p>

      <li>
      <p>Moderate Eye Contact</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Purpose</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Eye contact is important in establishing rapport with clients.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Variability</p>
      <ul>
      <li>It is important to remember that eye contact varies among different cultural backgrounds.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Significance</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The inability to make eye contact could mean that someone is afraid or insecure, it might also imply disinterest or dishonesty.</li>
      <li>On the other hand maintaining constant eye contact can be intimidating or make someone uncomfortable.</li>
      <li>Eye contact is a complex nonverbal behavior.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>

      <blockquote>
      <p>[Activity] What emotion are each of these facial features expressing?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Like everything in SW, It’s about self evaluation
      <ul>
      <li>Not only are are we looking at the facial features or affect of the client, but become aware of our own.</li>
      <li>Are our facial expressions corresponding with our other nonverbal behavior and what we are saying?</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Facial expressions provide an excellent means of communication.</li>
      <li>Facial expressions can be used to reinforce what is said verbally and emphasize the fact that you mean what you say.</li>
      <li>We need to be concerned about if we have incongruence and leakage (e.g. feelings about client leaked out)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>[Activity] Class participant to demonstrate space. (Clinicians should be at the closer end of social)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Distance
      <ul>
      <li>The use of personal space or distance between you and the client is a part of body positioning.</li>

      <p>When working with clients it is important how you present yourself nonverbally.</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>[Activity] Have a student act out what it might look like to be tense vs. relaxed.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Tension
      <ul>
      <li>Extreme tension could convey lack of confidence or excessive nervousness.</li>
      <li>It could cause distance between you and the client and they may have a difficult time feeling comfortable or trusting you.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Relaxed
      <ul>
      <li>But on the other hand being too relaxed could give the impression that you do not care much about what happens</li>
      <li>It could damage your professional credibility.</li>
