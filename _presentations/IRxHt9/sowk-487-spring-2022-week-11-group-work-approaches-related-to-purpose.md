  <p>Week 11’s focused on two types of groups and relating them to the task they are attempting to address. In this week’s readings, Root (2017) explains some of the considerations around psychoeducational groups, and Marshiglia and Kiehne (2017) dive into an example of prevention groups. The agenda for class today includes the following:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Psychoeducational groups</li>
  <li>Public Health Framework</li>
  <li>Other prevention frameworks and models</li>
  <li>Designing a school-based intervention</li>
  </ul>
