      <p>Making a good impression is essential.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>[Small Group Activity] Think of a person you would want to meet in history. Ask them to imagine that they have won a competition to meet and interview that person this afternoon for a local TV station. Talk with a partner about the following:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>what would you do?</li>
      <li>what would you wear?</li>
      <li>how would you feel?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>[Whole Class Activity - Discussion] Lead the discussion to get them to recognise they would make an effort with their appearance and their behaviour because they wanted to impress the person.</p>
      <p>Relate this to making a good impression with clients and collegues</p>
      <p>appearance
      body language
      greeting
      answering a query / helping the customer
      housekeeping and tidiness</p>
      <hr />
      <p><strong>Activity Information</strong>: This is a useful exercise to demonstrate to the group the importance of creating good impression.</p>
      <p><strong>Good for</strong>: team meetings, customer service training, refresher and review sessions. This exercise works well where people work face to face with customers</p>
      <p><strong>Length</strong>: Can vary depending on the time you have available, the size of group, and whether you do this in full group or in pairs. Suggested running time 15 - 30 minutes.</p>

      <li>
      <strong>Rapport</strong> with clients fosters open and free communication, which is the hallmark of effective interviews.</li>

      <strong>Starting with client motivation</strong> aids social workers in establishing and sustaining rapport and in maintaining psychological contact with clients.</li>
      <li>When ethnic minority and immigrant clients have virtually no command of the English language, effective communication requires the <strong>use of an interpreter</strong> of the same ethnicity as the client, so that the social worker and client bridge both cultural value differences and language differences.</li>

      <li>Because of the prevalence and magnitude of problems associated with <strong>substance abuse, violence, and sexual abuse</strong> in the society, the possibility that these problems contribute to or represent the primary source of clients’ difficulties should be routinely explored.</li>
