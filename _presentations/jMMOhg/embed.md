      <blockquote>
      <p>To start off our conversation about Cognitive-Behavioral Group Work, I thought that it would be helpful to discuss what is Cognitive behavioral therapy— CBT, a therapeutic approach which can help people with a wide range of mental health problems.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p>CBT is based on the idea that how we think (cognition), how we feel (emotion) and how we act (behavior) all interact together.  Specifically, our thoughts determine our feelings and our behavior. This is sometimes referred to as the cognitive triangle.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Bring awareness to <strong>negative interpretations of thoughts</strong>
      </li>
      <li>Review <strong>patters of behavior that reinforce distorted thinking</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Develop alternate ways of thinking</strong>

      <p>It might be helpful to see what some examples of group curriculum might be. While I would say that all of these curricula fall in the category of a Cognitive Behavioral Framework, they aren’t necessary 100% Cognitive-behavioral group work…</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>[Whole Class Activity] Spend time discussing each of the curricula and providing an overview.</p>
      <p>[Whole Class Activity] Have the class break up into three groups. Each group will have an opportunity to read through the curriculum from the three sources:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Guiding Good Choices Curriculum</li>
      <li>Dragon Slayers’ Curriculum</li>
      <li>Why Try Curriculum</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Consider discussion regarding the following:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>What stands out to you about the curriculum</li>
      <li>How are they the same or different</li>
      <li>How facilitated is each of the different curricula</li>
      </ul>
      <p>[Whole Class Activity] Discuss what they saw in the curriculum, what stood out… etc.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>[ ] Print out 01 copy of Dragon Slayers’ Curriculum</li>
      <li>[ ] Print out 01 copy of Why Try Curriculum</li>
      <li>[ ] Bring a copy of the curriculum for Guiding Good Choices Curriculum</li>

      <p>There are some therapeutic procedures which are either unavailable or less efficient for individual treatment and are often implemented when doing CBGW.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>The Buddy System</strong>: having a partner to learn new skills</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Group Exercises</strong>: Think about curriculum</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Multiple Modeling</strong>: ART as an example and multiple role plays</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Group Feedback</strong>: getting feedback from peers is sometimes more powerful than from a professional. Think about Drug and Alcohol groups and peoples BS detectors.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Group Brainstorming</strong>: Both to solve individual and group problems.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Mutual Reinforcement</strong>: Similar benefits as the mutual aid model.</li>

      <p>Some of the therapeutic procedures which are implemented in doing individual CBT can also be used in CBGW.</p>

      <li>
      <strong>Orientation</strong> - What are ways that we can provide an orientation for clients in a group?</li>

      <p>I want to share with all of you a tool that that I have often taught to clients. Grounding is a set of simple strategies to detach from emotional pain. To be grounding, it should fall under the following guidelines…</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Accessibility</strong>:  do it at any time, any place, anywhere, and no one has to know.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Broad</strong>:  put a healthy distance between you and negative feelings (useful for when faced with a trigger, enraged, dissociating, having a substance craving).</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Present Focused</strong>:  keep your eyes open, scan the room, and turn the lights on to stay in touch with the present.  Do not focus on the past or the future.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Scaling</strong>:  scale your emotions when using grounding.  Rate at your emotion (craving, impulse… etc) on a scale from 0-10 before beginning grounding.  After implementing your grounding technique, rate your emotion again.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Focus Outward</strong>:   Do not talk, think, or journal about your feelings.  The purpose of grounding is to distract away from negative feelings, not get in touch with them.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Stay Neutral</strong>:  avoid judgments of good and bad.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Not Relaxation Training</strong>:  note that grounding is not the same as relaxation training.  Grounding is more active, focuses on distraction strategies, and is intended to help extreme negative feelings.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Cognitive Change Methods</strong> is the bulk of types of interventions used in CBGW. The focus is on correcting distorted cognitions and replacing them with coping thoughts. This is oftentimes done through the techniques of cognitive restructuring. In ART, the following are the thought distortions they teach:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Self-centered Thinking</strong>: Thinking about only your own needs or interests, not caring about others. One example is saying “If I lie to people, it is nobody’s business but mine.”
      <strong>Assuming the Worst</strong>: Acting as if the worst outcome in a situation is the only possible outcome. Thinking people are out to get you. One example is saying, “I might as well lie, people won’t believe me if I tell the truth.”
      <strong>Blaming Others</strong>: Not accepting responsibility for your choices and consequences. Making it seem like someone forced you to act how you did. Saying someone else is responsible. One example is saying, “People make me lie when they ask too many questions.”
      <strong>Minimizing/mislabeling</strong>: Trying to make something ‘okay’ by making it less than or different from what it really is. One example is saying, “Everybody lies, it’s no big deal.”</p>
