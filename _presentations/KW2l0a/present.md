      <ul>
      <li>Are there other unethical experiments you have heard about, and what did they involve?</li>
      <li>What are some of your reactions to these studies (potential go through all five of them)?</li>

      <p>These types of unethical behaviors are exactly why there are IRBs for doing scientific researech. There are three types of IRB:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ol>
      <li>
      <strong>Exempt Review</strong>: lowest level of IRB review, for studies for studies with minimal risk or human subject involvement</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Expedited Review</strong>: middle level of IRB review, for studies with minimal risk but greater human subject involvement</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Full Board Review</strong>: highest level of IRB, for studies with greater than minimal risk to participants</li>

      <blockquote>
      <p>While all of that might seem a bit overwhelming and like a lot. Remember, that was a Full IRB Review. In thinking about your project for next semester if you are wanting to do conduct your project directly working with clients or a vulnerable population we would need to go through the IRB process (I believe). I would encourage some of you to consider this and starting thinking / working on it now.</p>

      <p>What might the process of Institutional Review Board Look Like at Heritage and for your project?</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>An important activity related to the ethics of social science research is that of informed consent</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>DeCarlo (2018) states “Informed consent is defined as a subject’s voluntary agreement to participate in research based on a full understanding of the research and of the possible risks and benefits involved. Although it sounds simple, ensuring that one has actually obtained informed consent is a much more complex process than you might initially presume”</p>
      <ul>
      <li>What were some of the issues related to not obtaining informed consent described both in the video we watch and the readings?</li>
      <li>Why is this so important?</li>
      <li>In what ways can effect the research design?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>DeCarlo (2018) describes that identity protection is another vital role of ethics in social science research methods.</p>

      <p>This includes the terms:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Anonymity</strong>: the identity of research participants is not known to researchers</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Confidentiality</strong>: identifying information about research participants is known to the researchers but is not divulged to anyone else</li>

      <p>Level of inquiry | Focus | Key ethics questions for researchers to ask themselves
      —- | —- | —-
      Micro | Individual | Does my research impinge on the individual’s right to privacy? Could my research offend subjects in any way? Could my research cause emotional distress to any of my subjects? Has my own conduct been ethical throughout the research process?
      Mezzo | Group | Does my research follow the ethical guidelines of my profession and discipline? Could my research negatively impact a community? Have I met my duty to those who funded my research?
      Macro | Society | Does my research meet the societal expectations of social research? Have I met my social responsibilities as a researcher?</p>

      <p>DeCarlo (2018) discusses the differences between scholars and decision to have the Nazi work published and cited by scholars. He poses the following questions:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Should data gathered by the Nazis be used or cited today?</li>
      <li>What arguments can you make in support of your position, and how would you respond to those who disagree?</li>
