      <p>“The adaptive capacity of any given family refers to the extent to which the family can achieve its functioning goals, given the demands of family and social life. As the family faces demands from its environment and challenges from its members, its capacity to adapt is a central property of the ability to maintain itself as a cohesive unit.” (p. 267)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>These stressors can be categorized by
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Family Cycle</strong>: Normative (normal) vs nonnormative (not expected)</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Frequency and Duration</strong>: Acute, Chronic, Episodic</li>
      <li>Magnitude and Number: Stressful life event vs daily hassles</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Family Strengths and Resilience</p>
      <ol>
      <li>
      <strong>Social support</strong>, from the community as well as from kinship bonds. Families who have active and vital social support networks have ready access to coping resources.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Internal cohesion and commitment</strong>. Families are able to adapt to adversity when family members have a strong sense of dedication to each other and when their patterns of communication lend themselves to a mutual understanding of family members’ thoughts, ideas, and feelings regarding adversity.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Creativity and flexibility</strong>. Families that strive for creative solutions to problems, including especially demonstrating flexibility in role assignments, enable families to find solutions to stressful situations.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Appraisal, insight, and meaning</strong>. When families strive to understand their difficulties and to find affirmative meaning in them, they have an increasing ability to sustain their problem-solving efforts under stress. Very often appraisal and insight are linked to family spirituality and belief systems.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Initiative and achievement</strong>. Families who are action-oriented tend to approach problem-solving using positive coping strategies such as cognitive coping, problem-solving, and constructive emotional regulation strategies.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Boundary setting</strong>. Families with a strong sense of family structure will seek to shield its members from unhelpful, unhealthy, and destructive influences.</li>

      <p>There can be a number roles that family members might fall under. Sometimes, especially in literature regarding substance abuse, there are roles described as co-dependent or dysfunctional considered common. We are going to spend some time examining those.</p>

      <p>The entire family life revolves around the addict or alcoholic. Each codependent role has been taken on in order to “make sense” of, and handle, the dysfunction in the everyday life of the family.</p>
      <p>Understanding the addict is very important. Of equal importance is knowing that by making changes in your own actions, you can stop supporting the addictive behavior of your loved one.</p>

      <li>The Mascot is often busy-busy-busy.</li>
      <li>They become anxious or depressed when things aren’t in constant motion.</li>
      <li>This hyperactivity makes it hard for them to concentrate very long on any one particularly thing, and this makes school or work difficult.</li>
