      the reliance on one person to another. People depend on each others input, energy, services, and consistency

      Transactions people communicate and interact with those in their environments [can be positive or negative]
      the natural power of active involvement among people and their environments takes place [input or output] the capacity to adjust to surrounding environmental conditions. This implies change because a person must adapt to change in order to continue functioning in their environment. Social workers help individuals during this process to direct their energies so that they are able to adapt a form of human adaptation and implies a struggle to overcome problems. Refers to the way we deal with the problems we experience.

presentation_description: >
  <p>Week two is a cross-sectional look at some of the perspectives, frameworks, and theories commonly used in social work. It should assist in gaining awareness about the difference between these ways of thinking discussed in social work literature. We will look into the following:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Perspectives, theories, and frameworks</li>
  <li>Systems theory</li>
  <li>Ecological perspective</li>
  <li>Strengths perspective</li>
  <li>Solution-focused brief therapy</li>
  </ul>
  <p>After this session, students will be able to articulate the difference between perspectives, theories, and frameworks. Students will also have knowledge about a couple of theoretical options for their integrative paper due later in the semester.</p>
