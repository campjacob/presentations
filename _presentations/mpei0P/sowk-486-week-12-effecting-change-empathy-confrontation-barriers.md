      <p>Ways of Using Additive Empathy •
      Deeper feelings Identify feelings implied or hinted at in clients’ verbal messages To identify feelings that underlie surface emotions To add intensity to feelings clients have minimized To clarify the nature of feelings clients express only vaguely To identify feelings manifested only nonverbally Challenging beliefs stated as facts
