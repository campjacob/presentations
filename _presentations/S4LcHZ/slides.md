      Some of the highlights
      This course provides the student with practical knowledge and skills to work with individuals, families, and communities with longer-term service needs. The student will be required to apply assessment and plan an effective intervention. The following is a listing of specific course prerequisites: None are listed.
      Course Purpose Social workers often work with vulnerable populations, and these vulnerable populations frequently include persons with special needs. Children with chronic healthcare conditions, developmental disorders, and congenital disabilities commonly access services done by social workers. This course builds on the knowledge and skills for working with individuals to gain further insight into research, applied services, and policy perspectives, reflecting the range of needs for persons requiring special assistance.
      Relationship to Other Sequences and Other Courses SOWK 322 is an online elective course offered to Toppenish and Tri-Cities Campus students. One of the 2022 Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS) described by the Council for Social Work Education (CSWE) is for students to engage in diversity and practice differences. Persons with severe disabilities and special needs require specialized services to meet those needs. This class is meant to introduce students to these needs.
      Land Acknowledgement Heritage University occupies its home on the traditional lands of the Yakama People. These ancestral homelands are the Yakama, Palouse, Pisquouse, Wenatshapam, Klikatat, Klinquit, Kow- was-say-ee, Li-aywas, Skin-pah, Wish-ham, Shyiks, Ochechotes, Kah-milt-pa, and Se-ap-cat, who today are represented by the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation [TREATY OF 1855] and, whose relationship with this land continues to this day. Heritage University, grounded in the vision of the two Yakama women founders, respects Indigenous peoples as traditional guardians of the lands and the enduring relationship that exists between Indigenous peoples and their traditional territories. We offer gratitude for the land itself, for those who have stewarded it for generations, and for the opportunity to study, learn, work, and be in community on this land. We acknowledge that our university‚Äôs history, like many others, is fundamentally tied to the first colonial developments in the Yakima Valley. Finally, we respectfully acknowledge and honor past, present, and future Indigenous students who will journey through this home</p>
