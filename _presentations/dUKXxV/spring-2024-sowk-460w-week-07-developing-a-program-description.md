      <p>USING LOGIC MODELS TO IDENTIFY KEY INFORMATION NEEDS Reviewing the logic model, ask yourself, “What information do we need to e ectively evaluate the processes and outcomes of the program?” Process A process is the implementation of a key component of the program. In the Kellogg logic model, processes are described as activities and quantified as outputs.

      Outcomes Outcomes are results that occur that are directly linked to program processes.

      <p>WRITING ABOUT YOUR DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM ➤
      Need: What need or needs is this program designed to meet?
      ➤
      Context: What is the program’s context? Be sure to discuss the contextual or cultural factors that may a ect the program’s e ectiveness?
      ➤
      Population Addressed: Who is included in the population for whom activities are intended?
      ➤
      Stage of Development: How long has the program been in place?
      ➤
      Resources: What resources (e.g., sta , money, space, faculty time, partnerships, technology, etc.) are available to support the program?
      ➤
      Activities: What speci c activities are conducted to achieve the program’s outcomes? (Note: Here is where you can provide additional information that you may have been asked to eliminate from the logic model, such as information on hours and availability of services, length of tutoring sessions, etc.)
      ➤
      Outputs: What do the activities produce? (Remember, these are goal numbers, in this case measuring services delivered.)
      ➤
      Outcomes: What are the program’s intended outcomes? (Remember that outcomes are changes in attitudes, skills, or behaviors of participants. You may want to divide outcomes into short-term, intermediate, and long-term categories—it’s up to you.)
      ➤
      Impact: What is the program’s intended impact on the larger community?

presentation_description: >
  <p>Week seven we will continue to be considering our logic models submitted last week. We will be delving into how we develop a program description. When we write our executive summary, it will include your logic model as a figure but there will also be a narrative description sharing about the needs the program is addressing, the context of the program, what population served by the program, the stage of development of the program, agency resources/activities/outputs/outcomes/impacts. As students have been developing their program evaluation, they are encouraged to start considering these inter-related questions. The agenda for the class session this week is as follows:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>A brief presentation about the MSW program by Dr. Juarez</li>
  <li>Planning for presentations</li>
  <li>Reviewing process for logic model development</li>
  <li>Developing a rubric for our logic models</li>
  <li>How we can develop a program description from our logic models</li>
  </ul>
