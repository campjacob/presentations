      The physical consequences of action determine its goodness or badness regardless of the human meaning or value of these consequences. Avoidance of punishment and unquestioning deference to power are valued in their own right.</p>

      Instrumental relativist orientation
      Right action consists of that which instrumentally satis es one’s own needs and occasionally the needs of others. Human relations are viewed in terms similar to those of the market place. Elements of fairness, of reciprocity, and equal sharing are present, but they are always interpreted in a physical pragmatic way. Reciprocity is a matter of “you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours,” not of loyalty, gratitude, or justice.</p>

      Good behaviour is that which pleases or helps others and is approved by them. There is much conformity to stereotypical images of what is majority or “natural” behaviour. Behaviour is frequently judged by intention: “he means well” becomes important for the rst time. One earns approval by being “nice.”</p>

      There is orientation toward authority, xed rules, and the maintenance of the social order. Right behaviour consists of doing one’s duty, showing respect for authority, and maintaining the given social order for its own sake.</p>

      Stage 5
      Social-contract legalistic orientation
      Generally, this stage has utilitarian overtones. Right action tends to be de ned in terms of general individual rights and in terms of standards that have been critically examined and agreed upon by the whole society. There is a clear awareness of the relativism of personal values and opinions and a corresponding emphasis on procedural rules for reaching consensus.</p>

      Universal ethicalprinciple orientation
      Right is de ned by the decision of conscience in accord with self-chosen ethical principles appealing to logical comprehensiveness, universality, and consistency. These principles are abstract and ethical (the Golden Rule, the categorical imperative); they are not concrete moral rules like the Ten Commandments. At heart, these are universal principles of justice, of the reciprocity and equality of human rights and of respect for the dignity of human beings as individual persons.</p>
