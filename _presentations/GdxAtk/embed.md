      <p>DEVELOP
      an action plan that is consistent with the ethical priorities that have been determined as central to the dilemma Have you conferred with clients and colleagues, as appropriate, about the potential risks and consequences of alternative courses of action? Can you support or justify your action plan with the values/principles on which the plan is based? (For example, have you conferred with all the necessary persons regarding the ethical dimensions of planning for a battered wife‚Äôs quest to secure secret shelter and the implications for her teen-aged children?)

      <p>IMPLEMENT
      your plan, utilizing the most appropriate practice skills and competencies
      How will you make use of core social work skills such as sensitive communication, skillful negotiation, and cultural competence? (For example, skillful colleague or supervisory communication and negotiation may enable an impaired colleague to see her/his impact on clients and to take appropriate action.)</p>
