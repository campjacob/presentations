  <p>Things are getting started for SOWK 322. This week’s readings are around a historical perspective of advocacy and creating change for persons who experience disabilities. I’ve made the assignments for who is doing which group, and you will get an opportunity to connect with your group members. The following are your learning objectives this week:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Identify historical perspectives on disability</li>
  <li>Describe general changes in policy over the past 300 years</li>
  <li>Prepare for group presentations</li>
  </ul>
