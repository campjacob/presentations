      <p>Dialectical theory states that reality is interrelated and connected, made of opposing forces, and always changing. In DBT, dialectics take the form of both a fundamental worldview as well as a method of persuasion (i.e., a set of communication strategies that the therapist uses to elicit change). (Rizvi et al., 2013, p. 76)</p>

      <p>Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Distress tolerance will help you cope better with painful events by building up your resiliency and giving you new ways to soften the e ects of upsetting circumstances. Mindfulness will help you experience more fully the present moment while focusing less on painful experiences from the past or frightening possibilities in the future. Mindfulness will also give you tools to overcome habitual, negative judgments about yourself and others. Emotion regulation skills help you to recognize more clearly what you feel and then to observe each emotion without getting overwhelmed by it. The goal is to modulate your feelings without behaving in reactive, destructive ways. Interpersonal e ectiveness gives you new tools to express your beliefs and needs, set limits, and negotiate solutions to problems‚Äîall while protecting your relationships and treating others with respect.

      <p>Developing Your Own Curriculum Include Discussion of the Following:
      ‚Ä¢ Objectives ‚Ä¢ Planned content ‚Ä¢ Short descriptions ‚Ä¢ In-depth details ‚Ä¢ Verbatim discussion ‚Ä¢ Tasks or roles
      Work with groups of four. Pick a topic for a group. Spend time thinking about what type of curriculum you would do, what parts you would include, and what are some of the information you would do. Plan one of the sessions.</p>

      <p>Practice Facilitating a Group</p>
      
presentation_description: >
  <p>In week 10, we start looking at treatment groups. To look at this, we will use the example of three types of groups. The week‚Äôs readings are around these topics. I also want to share some example curricula that you can see and review to get a picture of what this looks like. All of the readings for this week are good information, and I think they will help give you some perspective. Dialectical behavioral therapy is a frequently used group format, and Rizvi et al. (2013) provide a helpful overview of what it looks like. Next, Rose (2004) gives the example of cognitive-behavioral group work (CBGW). Even though most curricula don‚Äôt explicitly describe themselves as being founded in CBGW, I could argue that they are. Finally, Roffman (2004) reviews psychoeducational groups.</p>
  <p>The agenda for week 10 is as follows:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Group Intervention Pitch</li>
  <li>Psychoeducational group skills</li>
  <li>Curriculum used with pscyhoeducaitonal or CBGW</li>
  <li>Phases of the group process for CBGW</li>
  <li>Information about DBT</li>
  <li>Planning and implementation group</li>
  </ul>
