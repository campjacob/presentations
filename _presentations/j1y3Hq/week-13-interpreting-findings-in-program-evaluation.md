      ata can be classified into a nonnumerical or named categories, and the order in which these categories can be written or asked is arbitrary.
      he data can be classified into nonnumerical or named categories an inherent order exists among the response categories. Ordinal scales are seen in questions that call for ratings of quality (for example, very good, good, fair, poor, very poor) and agreement (for example, strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree).
      here numbers represent the possible response categories there is a natural ranking of the categories zero on the scale has meaning there is a quantifiable difference within categories and between consecutive categories.

      • Count
      (frequencies)
      • Percentage • Mean (average) • Mode (number of times)
      • Median (middle number)
      • Range • Standard deviation
      (amount of change)
      • Cross tabulation (comparative)
      • Change score
      (pretest / post test)
      • Quantitative
