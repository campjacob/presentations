      <p>There are a number of factors that influence goal development.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>[Whole Class Activity] Discuss Each what are examples of each of these.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Client Participation</strong>: Most important. Working harder than your client… influence commitment, self-definition, and self-efficacy</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Involuntary Status</strong>: Difficult to engage</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Values and Beliefs</strong>: client vs. practitioner goals and views</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Resources and Supports</strong>: Personal resources (think cognitive deficit and functioning), involvement of others</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Environmental Conditions</strong>: Complex and multi systemic</li>

      <blockquote>
      <p>There are many types of goals.
      “With individuals, this focus typically involves intrapersonal subsystems as well as their interaction with the social and physical environment. Goals may initially be expressed in broad terms.” (Hepworth, 2017, p. 319)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Cognitive functioning (e.g., increase positive self-talk)</li>
      <li>Emotional functioning (e.g., manage anger)</li>
      <li>Behavioral change (e.g., listen to others without interrupting).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These goals can be considered:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Overt (requires action)</li>
      <li>Covert (requires change in thought or perception)</li>
      <li>Shared (common and agreed on with group)</li>
      <li>Reciprocal (quid pro quo)</li>

      <p>The most common types of distortions and negative thinking patterns conceptualized by Beck (1976) have been summarized in the literature (Cormier, Nurius, &amp; Osborn, 2009; Leahy &amp; Holland, 2000; Walsh, 2006) and are as follows:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>[Whole Class Activity] Discuss each of the thinking errors, what they mean and possible examples of them. Can also look at what the opposite is that you would be trying to encourage in clients.</p>

      <li>All or nothing thinking</li>
      <li>Blaming</li>
      <li>Catastrophizing</li>
      <li>Discounting positives</li>
      <li>Emotional reasoning</li>
      <li>Inability to disconfirm: blocking ideas that don’t confirm beliefs</li>
      <li>Judgment focus: perception of self / others is based on assessment (focused on quality not description)</li>
      <li>Jumping to conclusions</li>
      <li>Mind reading</li>
      <li>Negative mental filtering: singling out bad events and ignoring positives</li>
      <li>Overgeneralization or globalization</li>
      <li>Personalizing: Taking on more responsibility for things then somebody has (i.e. role or actions made it happen)</li>
      <li>Regret orientation: focused on the past.</li>
      <li>“Should” statements: self failures</li>
      <li>Unfair comparisons</li>

      <p>There are some activities we can do as clinicians to assist in developing goals with involuntary clients.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Motivational Congruence</strong>: “work on target goals that are personally meaningful to the client and that also satisfy the requirements of the mandate” (Roony 2009 as cited in Hepworth, 2017, p. 322)</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Agreeable Mandate</strong>: Work on bridging differing views through cognitive re-framing and finding common ground.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Let’s Make a Deal</strong>: Work on negotiating through helping meet their needs.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Getting Rid of the Mandate</strong>: Focus on getting rid of services.</li>

      <p>The Kirst-Ashman and Hull (2015) divides up the needs into three categories. Translating problems into needs allows us to see start the process of determining what intervention is needed. A problem, without understanding the need the person has is not very helpful (i.e. Homeless might mean that the person needs to feel they have a stable place to stay… or …etc)</p>
