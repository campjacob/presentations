      <blockquote>
      <p>I want to spend some time talking about what we have been learning. I felt like a circle group would be the most productive way of doing this.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Group Norms:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>
      <strong>Respect the talking piece</strong>: everyone listens, everyone has a turn</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Speak from the heart</strong>: your truth, your perspectives, your expriences</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Listen from the heart</strong>: Let go of stories that make it hard to hear each other</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Trust that you know what to say</strong>: no need to rehearse</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Say just enough</strong>: without feeling rushed, be concise and considerate of the time of others</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
      <li>What are some things that you feel like you can take away from this class so far?</li>
      <li>What are ways that you are implementing or incorporating things you have been learning in any of your classes into your life?</li>
      <li>What do you need to be a better social worker as you progress through your education?</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
      <p>We oftentimes think about empathy as being able to put ourselves into someone else’s shoes. Still, we must also consider how we can teach our clients to put themselves into somebody’s shoes.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p>An important task for the social worker involves teaching clients to respond emphatically. Concerning this role, social workers should consider taking the following actions:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Teach clients the paradigm for empathic responding.</li>
      <li>Introduce clients to the list of affective words and phrases and to the Leads for Empathic Responses list.</li>
      <li>Intervene in sessions when clients ignore or fail to validate messages.</li>
      <li>Give positive feedback when clients listen to each other.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>[Small Group Activity] Work in teams of three or four to design a planned intervention for teaching empathy. What population would you work with, how would you teach them empathy, what would some of the sessions look like? You will have about 15 minutes to come up with ideas, and then you will share back with the group.</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>“Verbal following involves the use and sometimes blending of discrete skills that enable social workers to maintain psychological contact with clients on a moment-by-moment basis and to convey accurate understanding of their messages. Moreover, verbal following behavior takes into account two performance variables that are essential to satisfaction and continuance on the part of the client:”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Stimulus-response congruence</strong>: The extent to which social workers’ responses provide feedback to clients that their messages are accurately received.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Content relevance</strong>: The extent to which the content of social workers’ responses is perceived by clients as relevant to their substantive concerns.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Minimal prompts signal</strong> the social worker’s attentiveness and encourage the client to continue verbalizing.
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Nonverbal minimal prompts</strong> consist of nodding the head, using facial expressions, or employing gestures that convey receptivity, interest, and commitment to understanding. They implicitly convey the message, “I am with you; please continue.”</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Verbal minimal prompts</strong> consist of brief messages that convey interest and encourage or request expanded verbalizations along the lines of the client’s previous expressions.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Accent responses</strong> (Hackney &amp; Cormier, 2005) involve repeating, in a questioning tone of voice or with emphasis, a word or a short phrase. Suppose a client says, “I’ve really had it with the way my supervisor at work is treating me.” The social worker might reply, “Had it?”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There are two basic types of of reflection:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>
      <strong>Reflection of Content</strong>: emphasize the cognitive aspects of client messages, such as situations, ideas, objects, or persons (Hackney &amp; Cormier, 2005).</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Reflection of Affect</strong>: focus attention on the affective part of the communication (Cormier, Nurius, &amp; Osborn, 2009). In reflections of affect, social workers relate with responses that accurately capture clients’ affect and help them reflect on and sort through their feelings</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Reflection can take the form of the following forms:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Simple reflections</strong>, which identify the emotions expressed by the client, are a heritage from nondirective, client-centered counseling</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Complex reflections</strong> go beyond what the client has directly stated or implied, adding substantial meaning or emphasis to convey a more complex picture
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Reframing</strong>: is another form of adding content. Here, the social worker puts the client’s response in a different light beyond what the client had considered (Moyers et al., 2003)</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Double-sided reflection</strong>: Sometimes clients express indecision and conflict between several alternatives. that captures both sides of the dilemma that is fostering ambivalence about acting (Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002)</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Reflections with a twist</strong> are reflections in which the social worker agrees in essence with the dilemma expressed by the client but changes the emphasis, perhaps to indicate that the dilemma is not unsolvable but rather that the client has not at this time solved it (Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2013)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Closed-ended questions define a topic and restrict the client’s response to a few words or a simple yes or no answer.</p>
      
  - slide_name: deck-7173-large-9.jpeg
    slide_text: >
      <p>Open-ended questions and statements invite expanded expression and leave the client free to express what seems most relevant and important.</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>Seeking concreteness is an important aspect of drawing out information from a client. We can use it to obtain concreteness in a number of areas:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Checking out Perceptions</strong>: Understanding how they view the world</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Clarifying the Meaning of Vague or Unfamiliar Terms</strong>: Clients often times use vague terms. What does this actually mean?</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Exploring the Basis of Conclusions Drawn by Clients</strong>: Why do they think things are this way</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Assisting Clients in Personalizing Their Statements</strong>: Helping understand what it means for them…
      <ul>
      <li>Focus on self</li>
      <li>Focus on others</li>
      <li>Focus on group or relationships</li>
      <li>Focus on content</li>

      <strong>Eliciting Specific Feelings</strong>: How do they feel more specifically.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Focusing on the Here and Now</strong>: moving out of the past.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Eliciting Details Related to Clients’ Experiences</strong>: What they’ve done</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Eliciting Details Related to Interactional Behavior</strong>: How their interactions has been</li>

      <p>Four Distinct facets of summarizing:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>
      <strong>Highlighting key aspects</strong> of discussions of specific problems, strengths, and resources before changing the focus of the discussion</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Making connections</strong> between relevant aspects of lengthy client messages</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Reviewing major focal points</strong> of a session and tasks that clients plan to work on before the next session</li>
      <li>Recapitulating the highlights of a <strong>previous session</strong> and reviewing <strong>clients’ progress</strong> on tasks during the week for the purpose of providing focus and continuity between sessions</li>

      <p>One way of the most effective ways to learn about a topic, is to teach it. You are going to get a short opportunity to teach your classmates interviewing techniques.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Having six different groups you will each be assigned one of the six interviewing techniques</li>
      <li>Spend 15-20 minutes deciding how you can teach the two skills to your classmates</li>
      <li>Teach the two skills to your classmates, teaching exercises should be 3-7 minutes in length.</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
      <p>The various interviewing techniques are as follows:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Furthering responses</li>
      <li>Reflection responses</li>
      <li>Closed-ended questions &amp; open-ended questions</li>
      <li>Providing and maintaining focus</li>
      <li>Seeking concreteness</li>
      <li>Summarizing</li>

      <p>[Individual Activity] Read the statement below regarding the 80 year old woman. Come up with some possible empathetic responses that a social worker could do.</p>
      <p>[Partner Group Activity] Share your responses with a partner. Discuss with your partner what level you think your empathetic responses were</p>
      <p><strong>Single woman, age 80</strong> [to social worker concerning her request to move to an independent living complex provided for ambulatory older persons]:</p>
      <p>Goodness, the more I think of moving, the more scared I get. I have neighbors here who look after me, and I won’t know a soul there. I’m afraid I’ll be all alone.</p>

      <p>[Small Group Activity] Work in groups of 4 or 5 to review the statement about this 16 year old male client. Come up with some empathetic responses at each of the levels.</p>
      <p><strong>Male, age 16</strong> [in weekly visit to social work probation officer]:</p>
      <p>I don’t see the sense in having to come here every (expletive) week. I haven’t been in any trouble now since I went to court a month ago. You should know by now you can trust me.</p>
