      <p>Polyvagal Theory: Stephen Porges
      There is a 3rd System: The Social Nerve System We are hard wired to be in groups and to be socially engaged. We use the face, eyes, ears to make those connections We seek balance and to be harmonious inside and outside When socially isolated more likely to go into fight, flight, freeze or fawn</p>
