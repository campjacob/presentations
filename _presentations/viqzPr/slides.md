Treatment of children with learning disorders from a self-psychological perspective revolves around the centrality of the child's self-experience. This includes working with children (and their caregivers) to identify the development of maladaptive defenses before they become part of the structure of the personality.'- Citation: '(Cooper & Granucci Lesser, 2022, p. 100)'"
