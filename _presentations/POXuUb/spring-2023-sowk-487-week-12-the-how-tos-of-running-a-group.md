      <p>USING ACTIVITIES 1. How prescriptive should the activity be? (i.e. is it a free wheeling activity like a game of tag or one that requires detailed instruction like chess?); 2. How is the activity regulated or controlled? (i.e. does the activity allow for some autonomy and control among the members or is it purely leader controlled?); 3. What are the relationship demands or levels of interaction required? (i.e. is it a side-by-side arts and crafts activity or a face-to-face intense role playing exercise); and 4. What is the level of competence required? (i.e. is it an activity that will leave anyone feeling incompetent or inferior or does everyone have a reasonable chance at feeling they have successfully participated; or is it an activity that might frustrate a bit, in an attempt to help members, in part, to develop greater frustration tolerance, for example).

      <p>CLARITY OF GROUP PURPOSE The purpose of the group can be stated clearly and concisely by both clients and the worker The stated purpose is the same for both clients and the worker, even if they might express it in different words The purpose is speci ic enough to provide direction and implications for group content
      a clearly de ined purpose is the powerful ally of group workers and members alike. It is crucial to the success of the groups with which we work.
      The purpose is speci ic enough so that both clients and the worker will know when it has been achieved (p. 106)

      <p>COMMON MISTAKES OF PRACTITIONERS Related to Sharing Purpose Practitioners promote a group Purpose without adequate consideration of client need. Practitioners confuse group Purpose with group content. Practitioners state group Purpose at such a high level of generality that it is vague and meaningless and, therefore, provides little direction for the group. Practitioners are reluctant to share with the members their perceptions and ideas about the group’s Purpose. Practitioners function with a hidden Purpose in mind that they do not share with the group. Practitioners do not understand Purpose as a dynamic, evolving concept that changes over the life of the group. Instead, they view Purpose as static and ixed.
