      <p>A program logic model is a picture of how an organization does its work — the theory and assumptions underlying the program. A program logic model links outcomes (both short- and long-term) with program activities/processes and the theoretical principles/assumptions of the program.</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>There are a number of reasons why it is useful to have a logic model for a program.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Stakeholders are allowed to articulate their views about the program</li>
      <li>Stakeholders are allowed to hear and appreciate the views of other stakeholders</li>
      <li>Divergent views about the program are synthesized in a collaborative process.</li>
      <li>An integrated model is developed with stakeholder ownership</li>
      <li>The integrated model is scrutinized publicly for feasibility</li>
      <li>The model serves as a solid reference for program management decisions</li>
      <li>The model is used as an organizing tool for evaluation</li>
      <li>The model can be used as a promotional tool for the program</li>
      <li>The model can be employed to support program proposals for grant activities</li>
      </ul>
