      <li>Explain to students that most students who begin their freshman year at Heritage don’t earn a degree</li>
      <li>Give students to come up with an explanation for why this is happening</li>
      <li>Encourage them to draw diagrams to illustrate their explanation</li>

      <p>The various way that we talk and think about research follows a number of different areas of interest. This include:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Ontology</strong>: What is reality?</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Epistemology</strong>: What and how can I know reality or knowledge?</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Theoretical perspective</strong>: What approach can we use to get knowledge?</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Methodology</strong>: What procedures can we use to acquire knowledge?</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Methods</strong>: What tools can we acquire knowledge?</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Sources</strong>: What data can we collect?</li>

      <p>As we start to look into what theoretical perspective we will following, it is driven by our ontology epistemology. Both the ontology and epistemology are encompassed by what paradigm we choose to relate to our research.</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>We can start by defining what is a paradigm.</p>

      <p>There are four paradigms that we generally consider when we think about social work research. The paradigm that is most frequently thought of as we consider social work research is that of Positivism.</p>

      <p><strong>Positivism Paradigm</strong>: objectivity, deductive logic, empiricism, value-free science
      <strong>Assumptions</strong>: Society can and should be studied empirically and scientifically.</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>An inquiry would look at “precisely measuring substance abuse and finding out the key causes of substance abuse during adolescence. Forgoing the objectivity of precisely measuring substance abuse”</p>
