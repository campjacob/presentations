      <blockquote>
      <p>“Clients often have an unclear idea about what to expect from contact with a social worker, and those ideas may differ from the social worker’s expectations as well (Kadushin &amp; Kadushin, 1997). This is most evident when the client has been referred or mandated for service. Clarifying expectations becomes a key intervention in work with clients who have not chosen to see a social worker (Rooney et al., 2009; Trotter, 2006).”</p>

      <strong>Determine your client expectations</strong>: Ask questions to determine what their expectations. Help them to manage unrealistic or unreasonable expectations.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Emphasize client responsibility</strong>: What are the expectations that you or others have on them.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Emphasize difficulties inherent in the process</strong>: Making change is hard. Extinction burst.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Clarify your own role</strong>: What will you be doing and expectations they can have on you</li>

      <blockquote>
      <p>Carl Rodgers and person Center Counseling probably give the best and most focus on basic helping attitudes.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>The facilitative conditions (or core conditions) in helping relationships were originally denoted by Carl Rogers (1957) as…</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Empathy</li>
      <li>Unconditional positive regard</li>
      <li>Congruence</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Much of the current research describes these as:</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Warmth</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Authenticity</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Empathy</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Facilitative conditions are often thought to be the foundation-level skills that undergird many treatment models and help create a positive client–social worker relationship.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Research has especially supported the correlation of empathy with positive social work outcomes.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>The facilitative skills are particularly useful in treatment situations with voluntary clients.</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>With empathy being such an important skill, we need to discuss how we can develop perceptiveness to feelings. As well we know that feelings or emotions exert a powerful influence on behavior and often play a central role in the problems of clients.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>To respond to the broad spectrum of emotions and feeling states presented by clients, the social worker must be fully aware of the diversity of human emotions.
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Position of not knowing…</strong>
      </li>
      <li>They also need to take a “not knowing” position of learning what emotional expression means for the particular client in front of them.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>It is important to realize that high-level empathic responding takes place in two phases:
      <ul>
      <li>A thinking process</li>
      <li>A responding process</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Applicants or voluntary clients often enter into the helping relationship with openness, hoping to explore both their concerns and their related feelings.</p>

      <p>[Partner Group Activity] With partner, take turns sharing respectively for about five minutes, about an experience that they experienced a emotional response (any emotion, happiness, sadness, excitement, nervousness, etc. - does not need to be an overly personal story.)

      <p>[Whole Class Activity] What is authenticity and why is it important?</p>

      <p>Authenticity is defined as the sharing of self by relating in a natural, sincere, spontaneous, open, and genuine manner.</p>

      <p>“Viewed from a therapeutic perspective, self-disclosure encourages clients to reciprocate with trust and openness. Lee (2014) has identified two types of self-disclosure: self-involving statements and personal self-disclosure” (Hepworth, et al., 2017)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Self-involving statements</strong> include messages that express the social worker’s personal reaction to the client during the course of a session.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Personal self-disclosure messages</strong>, by contrast, center on struggles or problems the social worker is currently experiencing or has experienced that are similar to the client’s problems</li>

      <p>As social workers practice authentic responding and teach clients to respond authentically in their encounters with others, they should keep in mind the following guidelines related to the four elements of an authentic message:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Personalize messages with the pronoun “I.”</li>
      <li>Share feelings that lie at varying depths.</li>

      <p>“Verbal following involves the use and sometimes blending of discrete skills that enable social workers to maintain psychological contact with clients on a moment-by-moment basis and to convey accurate understanding of their messages. Moreover, verbal following behavior takes into account two performance variables that are essential to satisfaction and continuance on the part of the client:”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Stimulus-response congruence</strong>: The extent to which social workers’ responses provide feedback to clients that their messages are accurately received.</li>

      <strong>Content relevance</strong>: The extent to which the content of social workers’ responses is perceived by clients as relevant to their substantive concerns.</li>

      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Minimal prompts signal</strong> the social worker’s attentiveness and encourage the client to continue verbalizing.
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Nonverbal minimal prompts</strong> consist of nodding the head, using facial expressions, or employing gestures that convey receptivity, interest, and commitment to understanding. They implicitly convey the message, “I am with you; please continue.”</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Verbal minimal prompts</strong> consist of brief messages that convey interest and encourage or request expanded verbalizations along the lines of the client’s previous expressions.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Accent responses</strong> (Hackney &amp; Cormier, 2005) involve repeating, in a questioning tone of voice or with emphasis, a word or a short phrase. Suppose a client says, “I’ve really had it with the way my supervisor at work is treating me.” The social worker might reply, “Had it?”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There are two basic types of of reflection:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>
      <strong>Reflection of Content</strong>: emphasize the cognitive aspects of client messages, such as situations, ideas, objects, or persons (Hackney &amp; Cormier, 2005).</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Reflection of Affect</strong>: focus attention on the affective part of the communication (Cormier, Nurius, &amp; Osborn, 2009). In reflections of affect, social workers relate with responses that accurately capture clients’ affect and help them reflect on and sort through their feelings</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Reflection can take the form of the following forms:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Simple reflections</strong>, which identify the emotions expressed by the client, are a heritage from nondirective, client-centered counseling</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Complex reflections</strong> go beyond what the client has directly stated or implied, adding substantial meaning or emphasis to convey a more complex picture
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Reframing</strong>: is another form of adding content. Here, the social worker puts the client’s response in a different light beyond what the client had considered (Moyers et al., 2003)</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Double-sided reflection</strong>: Sometimes clients express indecision and conflict between several alternatives. that captures both sides of the dilemma that is fostering ambivalence about acting (Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002)</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Reflections with a twist</strong> are reflections in which the social worker agrees in essence with the dilemma expressed by the client but changes the emphasis, perhaps to indicate that the dilemma is not unsolvable but rather that the client has not at this time solved it (Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2013)</li>
      </ul>
