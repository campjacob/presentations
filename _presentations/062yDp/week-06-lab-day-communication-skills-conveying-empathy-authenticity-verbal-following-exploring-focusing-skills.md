      <li>
      <strong>Speak from the heart</strong>: your truth, your perspectives, your expriences</li>

      <blockquote>
      <p>We often times think about empathy as being able to put ourselves into someone else’s shoes, but we must also think how we can teach our clients to put themselves into somebody  shoes.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p>An important task for the social worker involves teaching clients to respond emphatically. With respect to this role, social workers should consider taking the following actions:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Teach clients the paradigm for empathic responding.</li>
      <li>Introduce clients to the list of affective words and phrases and to the Leads for Empathic Responses list.</li>
      <li>Intervene in sessions when clients ignore or fail to validate messages.</li>
      <li>Give positive feedback when clients listen to each other.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
      <p>“Verbal following involves the use and sometimes blending of discrete skills that enable social workers to maintain psychological contact with clients on a moment-by-moment basis and to convey accurate understanding of their messages. Moreover, verbal following behavior takes into account two performance variables that are essential to satisfaction and continuance on the part of the client:”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Stimulus-response congruence</strong>: The extent to which social workers’ responses provide feedback to clients that their messages are accurately received.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Content relevance</strong>: The extent to which the content of social workers’ responses is perceived by clients as relevant to their substantive concerns.</li>
      </ul>
      
  - slide_name: deck-3661-large-6.jpeg
    slide_text: >
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Minimal prompts signal</strong> the social worker’s attentiveness and encourage the client to continue verbalizing.
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Nonverbal minimal prompts</strong> consist of nodding the head, using facial expressions, or employing gestures that convey receptivity, interest, and commitment to understanding. They implicitly convey the message, “I am with you; please continue.”</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Verbal minimal prompts</strong> consist of brief messages that convey interest and encourage or request expanded verbalizations along the lines of the client’s previous expressions.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Accent responses</strong> (Hackney &amp; Cormier, 2005) involve repeating, in a questioning tone of voice or with emphasis, a word or a short phrase. Suppose a client says, “I’ve really had it with the way my supervisor at work is treating me.” The social worker might reply, “Had it?”</li>
      </ul>
      
  - slide_name: deck-3661-large-7.jpeg

      <p>There are two basic types of of reflection:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>
      <strong>Reflection of Content</strong>: emphasize the cognitive aspects of client messages, such as situations, ideas, objects, or persons (Hackney &amp; Cormier, 2005).</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Reflection of Affect</strong>: focus attention on the affective part of the communication (Cormier, Nurius, &amp; Osborn, 2009). In reflections of affect, social workers relate with responses that accurately capture clients’ affect and help them reflect on and sort through their feelings</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Reflection can take the form of the following forms:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Simple reflections</strong>, which identify the emotions expressed by the client, are a heritage from nondirective, client-centered counseling</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Complex reflections</strong> go beyond what the client has directly stated or implied, adding substantial meaning or emphasis to convey a more complex picture
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Reframing</strong>: is another form of adding content. Here, the social worker puts the client’s response in a different light beyond what the client had considered (Moyers et al., 2003)</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Double-sided reflection</strong>: Sometimes clients express indecision and conflict between several alternatives. that captures both sides of the dilemma that is fostering ambivalence about acting (Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002)</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Reflections with a twist</strong> are reflections in which the social worker agrees in essence with the dilemma expressed by the client but changes the emphasis, perhaps to indicate that the dilemma is not unsolvable but rather that the client has not at this time solved it (Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2013)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Closed-ended questions define a topic and restrict the client’s response to a few words or a simple yes or no answer.</p>
      
  - slide_name: deck-3661-large-9.jpeg
    slide_text: >
      <p>Open-ended questions and statements invite expanded expression and leave the client free to express what seems most relevant and important.</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>Seeking concreteness is an important aspect of drawing out information from a client. We can use it to obtain concreteness in a number of areas:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Checking out Perceptions</strong>: Understanding how they view the world</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Clarifying the Meaning of Vague or Unfamiliar Terms</strong>: Clients often times use vague terms. What does this actually mean?</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Exploring the Basis of Conclusions Drawn by Clients</strong>: Why do they think things are this way</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Assisting Clients in Personalizing Their Statements</strong>: Helping understand what it means for them…
      <ul>
      <li>Focus on self</li>
      <li>Focus on others</li>
      <li>Focus on group or relationships</li>

      <li>
      <strong>Focusing on the Here and Now</strong>: moving out of the past.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Eliciting Details Related to Clients’ Experiences</strong>: What they’ve done</li>

      <p>Four Distinct facets of summarizing:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>
      <strong>Highlighting key aspects</strong> of discussions of specific problems, strengths, and resources before changing the focus of the discussion</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Making connections</strong> between relevant aspects of lengthy client messages</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Reviewing major focal points</strong> of a session and tasks that clients plan to work on before the next session</li>
      <li>Recapitulating the highlights of a <strong>previous session</strong> and reviewing <strong>clients’ progress</strong> on tasks during the week for the purpose of providing focus and continuity between sessions</li>

      <p>Empathic responding is a fundamental yet complex skill that requires systematic practice and extensive effort to achieve competency.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Some social workers dismiss the need for training in empathic responding, mistakenly believing themselves to already be empathic in their contacts with clients.</li>

      <blockquote>
      <p>Level 1: Low level of empathic responding</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Limited awareness or understanding of the client’s feelings; the social worker’s responses are irrelevant and often abrasive, hindering rather than facilitating communication</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Common problems related to level one are…</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Giving advice</li>
      <li>Persuading with logical argument</li>
      <li>Negativity evaluating the client</li>

      <p>Responding to client’s surface message but omitting feelings or factual aspects</p>
