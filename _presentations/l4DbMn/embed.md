      WHAT IS PARTICIPATORY ACTION RESEARCH? PAR is a qualitative methodology that includes collaboration at all levels of the research process and an intention to address a social problem that a ects an underserved community. (Creswell et al., 2007) Participatory Co-researchers participate in re ection on how to grapple with the target problem, both individually and collectively. Then the group cooperatively decides what actions are necessary to address the identi ed needs. Action During the process, the co-researchers build alliances through planning, implementation, and dissemination of the research Research fi ff fl (McIntyre, 2008)

      􁈏 CO-RESEARCHER : Noun \ (ˌ)kō-ri-ˈsər-chər Participants as co-researchers refers to a participatory method of research that situates participants as joint contributors and investigators to the findings of a research project. This qualitative research approach validates and privileges the experiences of participants, making them experts and therefore co-researchers and collaborators in the process of gathering and interpreting data. (Boylorn, 2012, p. 600)

      CENTRAL FEATURES OF PARTICIPATORY ACTION RESEARCH PAR IS A SOCIAL PROCESS IT IS PARTICIPATORY IT IS EMANCIPATORY IT IS CRITICAL IT IS RECURSIVE (REFLEXIVE, DIALECTICAL) (Kemmis & Wilkinson, 1998)

      HOW PAR VIEWS KNOWLEDGE Epistemological The process is designed to draw out the participants’ experiences and inner wisdom as a procedure for de ning a group’s needs as a group. The group is also used to analyze and address those needs (Coleman, 2015). fi Lincoln et al. (2011) also expound that PAR as being a type of critical subjectivity. Within the critical methodologies, they make understanding group power dynamics a key point. They also work to address social change or action through the research process.
