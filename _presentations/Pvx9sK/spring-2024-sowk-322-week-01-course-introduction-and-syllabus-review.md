The student will be required to apply assessment and plan an effective intervention. The following is a listing of specific course prerequisites: None are listed.
      Course Purpose Social workers often work with vulnerable populations, and these vulnerable populations frequently include persons with special needs. Children with chronic healthcare conditions, developmental disorders, and congenital disabilities commonly access services done by social workers. This course builds on the knowledge and skills for working with individuals to gain further insight into research, applied services, and policy perspectives, reflecting the range of needs for persons requiring special assistance.
      Relationship to Other Sequences and Other Courses SOWK 322 is an online elective course offered to Toppenish and Tri-Cities Campus students. One of the 2022 Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS) described by the Council for Social Work Education (CSWE) is for students to engage in diversity and practice differences. Persons with severe disabilities and special needs require specialized services to meet those needs. This class is meant to introduce students to these needs.
