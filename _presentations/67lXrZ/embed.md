      <p>How we manage and deal with verbal and non verbal behavior has a lot to do with how we are able to communicate.

      <li>Human interaction and communication involve both verbal and nonverbal behavior.</li>
      <li>Verbal behavior is what is being said.</li>
      <li>Non verbal behavior is communication in ways other than spoken words.</li>
      <li>People communicate by…
      <ul>
      <li>Facial expressions</li>
      <li>Hand movements</li>
      <li>Eye contact</li>
      <li>Sitting position</li>
      <li>Proximity</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Any aspect of a person’s presence that conveys ideas or information without being spoken is nonverbal communication.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
      <p>Any aspect of a person’s presence that conveys ideas or information without being spoken is nonverbal communication. In communication in general, there are six basic parts of communication:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ol>
      <li>Attentive listening</li>
      <li>Eye contact</li>
      <li>Facial expressions</li>
      <li>Body positioning</li>
      <li>Paraverbal</li>
      <li>Verbal</li>
      </ol>
      <blockquote>
      <p>As we think about these verbal and non verbal aspects, we should also be thinking about this threefold task:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>(1) to assess your repetitive nonverbal behaviors
      (2) to eliminate nonverbal styles that hinder effective communication
      (3) to sustain and perhaps increase desirable nonverbal behaviors</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>The opposite of talking isn’t listening. The opposite of talking is waiting.
      ~ Fran Lebowitz</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Attentive listening implies more than just audio reception of the words that are said.  It focuses on comprehending  the meaning of what is said. This can be called physical attending.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It takes really focusing on the person that you are talking to.</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>We don’t want to have no eye contact and we don’t want to have constant eye contact. We want to have moderate eye contact, which is somewhere in between no eye contact and constant eye contact.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Not extremes…</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>No Eye Contact</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Constant Eye Contact</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Moderate Eye Contact</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Purpose</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Eye contact is important in establishing rapport with clients.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Variability</p>
      <ul>
      <li>It is important to remember that eye contact varies among different cultural backgrounds.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Significance</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The inability to make eye contact could mean that someone is afraid or insecure, it might also imply disinterest or dishonesty.</li>
      <li>On the other hand maintaining constant eye contact can be intimidating or make someone uncomfortable.</li>
      <li>Eye contact is a complex nonverbal behavior.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>

      <blockquote>
      <p>[Activity] What emotion are each of these facial features expressing?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Like everything in SW, It’s about self evaluation
      <ul>
      <li>Not only are are we looking at the facial features or affect of the client, but become aware of our own.</li>
      <li>Are our facial expressions corresponding with our other nonverbal behavior and what we are saying?</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Facial expressions provide an excellent means of communication.</li>
      <li>Facial expressions can be used to reinforce what is said verbally and emphasize the fact that you mean what you say.</li>
      <li>We need to be concerned about if we have incongruence and leakage (e.g. feelings about client leaked out)</li>

      <p>[Activity] Class participant to demonstrate space. (Clinicians should be at the closer end of social)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Distance
      <ul>
      <li>The use of personal space or distance between you and the client is a part of body positioning.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Psychomotor behavior (Body Positioning)
      <ul>
      <li>Body movement and positioning also provide information to others.</li>

      <li>Tension vs. Relaxed Positions</li>

      <blockquote>
      <p>When working with clients it is important how you present yourself nonverbally.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p>[Activity] Have a student act out what it might look like to be tense vs. relaxed.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Tension
      <ul>
      <li>Extreme tension could convey lack of confidence or excessive nervousness.</li>
      <li>It could cause distance between you and the client and they may have a difficult time feeling comfortable or trusting you.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Relaxed
      <ul>
      <li>But on the other hand being too relaxed could give the impression that you do not care much about what happens</li>
      <li>It could damage your professional credibility.</li>

      <blockquote>
      <p>One way of responding to a difficult story, such as the freedom writer clip we watch is through reflective responding. Lets talk about what each of these are:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>There are two basic types of of reflection:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>
      <strong>Reflection of Content</strong>: emphasize the cognitive aspects of client messages, such as situations, ideas, objects, or persons (Hackney &amp; Cormier, 2005).</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Reflection of Affect</strong>: focus attention on the affective part of the communication (Cormier, Nurius, &amp; Osborn, 2009). In reflections of affect, social workers relate with responses that accurately capture clients’ affect and help them reflect on and sort through their feelings</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Sometimes you see things such as paraphrasing, parroting, etc.</p>
      <p>Reflection can take the form of the following forms:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Simple reflections</strong>, which identify the emotions expressed by the client, are carried over from nondirective, client-centered counseling</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Showing up at school that first day sounds like you were very anxious.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Complex reflections</strong> go beyond what the client has directly stated or implied, adding substantial meaning or emphasis to convey a more complex picture</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Showing up at school that first day it sounds like you were very anxious, but that you had a lot of determination to go regardless.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Reframing</strong>: is another form of adding content. Here, the social worker puts the client’s response in a different light beyond what the client had considered (Moyers et al., 2003)</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
      <p>When you connected people in your support system, it sounds like it helped you feel more comfortable.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The text also talks about</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Double-sided reflection</li>
      <li>Reflections with a twist</li>
      </ul>
      <p>and I don’t want to focus on those today.</p>

      <p>I want to spend some time today practicing reflecting responding. You can also be thinking about the other furthering responses in addition to this, but I want you to be thinking specifically about these.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>[Small Group Activity] In groups of 3 (maybe four) you will have the opportunity to have a dialog. Talk about any topic that you would like. You will need to be able to talk about the topic for about 5 minutes minimum. It should be something that you are at least somewhat passionate about or has some sort of emotion tied to it. It could be a hobby, an interest, a story. Do the following:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Assign roles to group members. Observer, interviewer, and interviewee.</li>
      <li>Pick the topic and have the interviewer guide the conversation, intentionally trying to use some reflective responding.</li>
      <li>After 5 minutes, debrief, using the following question (you will have about thee minutes)
      <ul>
      <li>How did it feel as the interviewer to use the techniques</li>
      <li>How did it feel as the interviewee</li>
      <li>What did the observer notice</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Switch roles and do it again.</li>
