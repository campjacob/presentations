      <p>We are going to be talking about risk and protective factors later today. I wanted to start with an activity to see how they interact.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Obtain volunteers for each protective factor
      <ul>
      <li>Adolescent, parent, grandparent, coach, minister, friend</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Have form a circle of protection around the adolescent joining hands</li>
      <li>Obtain volunteers for risk factors
      <ul>
      <li>convenience store operator, other friend, brother, school board president</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Instruct people representing risk factors to try to “get to” our adolescents through the circle of protection without causing any bodily injury. After a minute or so, help participants debrief what they saw or heard happening.</li>
      <li>___________ is pretty well protective here. We could form a group of parents to tell the convenience store operators they’ve had enough and will not allow the sale of alcohol to minors. They will picket the store, etc.</li>
      <li>Bring person into circle too</li>
      <li>Feedback</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The reading this week reviewed three different approaches for group work related to purpose. These were:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Self-Help and Support Groups</strong>: Very related to the conversation we had regarding mutual aid groups and those concepts.
      <strong>Psychoeducation Groups</strong>: groups which are trying to either provide education, skill acquisition, and or self-knowledge.
      <strong>Prevention Groups</strong>: applying prevention concepts to a wide range of problems.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Today I want to spend time talking some about out prevention groups and psycho educational groups.</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>Psychoeducational groups necessarily place social workers in the role of a teacher. This role, and by extension the deliver of information should not be imagined as  one way relationship.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Brown 2003 suggests that there are basic principals to deliver effective psychoeducaitonal groups:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Selecting optimum methods for delivering information based on participant factors (e.g., age, previous learning, motivation)</li>
      <li>Demonstrating the meaningfulness of material among group members</li>
      <li>Creating opportunities for group members to integrate new information with existing knowledge and skills;</li>
      <li>Encouraging retention of new information by doing</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Engaging in group work practice requires some familiarity with styles of leadership conducive to facilitating psychoeducaitonal groups.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Education on preparing and delivering</strong>: Education and/or training on preparing and delivering psychoeducational groups</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Knowledge of Group Process</strong>: Knowledge of group processes, including common stages of group development</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Supervision</strong>: Purposeful and targeted supervision related to group practices</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Interpersonal practice skills</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Capacity to self-reflect</strong> and challenge personal axes of privilege, power, and oppression</li>
      <li>Normalizing without essentializing</li>
      <li>Connection of group content to anticipated stage of group development</li>

      <blockquote>
      <p>We can think of two basic types of psychoeducaitonal groups. Those that are manualized and those that are responsive.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>The current trend is towards integration of both types (i.e. manualized curricula with flexibility to and awareness of groups processes)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The public health framework is a method for creating change at various levels using the following key ideas:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>[Whole Class Activity] For each key idea, relate it to PDC and coalition work.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Defining the target</strong>: A clearly identified area of focus.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Understanding Risk and Protection</strong>: Through research-based knowledge finding corollary or casual finding how things relate to the target. Risks are the factors that are those things which play causal role that has a perceived negatively where protective factors are those ones that are perceived as positive.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Interrupting Risk and Building Protection</strong>: Develop interventions designed to interrupt risk processes or promoting protective processes.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Assessing the Effectiveness of Prevention</strong>: Assess level of change.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Prevention groups can chose to either do universal prevention or they can do selective prevention.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Universal is focused on things provided to everybody.
      Selective is where a group is specifically targeted.</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>Selective practice can be related to some of the following considerations:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>[Whole Class Activity] Elicit examples of each.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Person-Environment Fit</strong>: groups using cognitive behavioral approach to improve person in the environment fit (i.e. group addressing beliefs about condom use and how to get partner to use)
      <ul>
      <li>Focus on individual change or group change</li>
      <li>Can be skill building (role play)</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      <strong>Human Development</strong>: Interventions should be built on research based knowledge of human development.
      <ul>
      <li>Built on needs that are presented</li>
      <li>Reviews developmental transitions
      <strong>Culturally Competent Practice</strong>: Cultural Humility
      Can also have indicated services, which are focused on needs that have been demonstrated or require a higher level of support. These indicated needs are often preformed by an outside professional or persons with more specific training.</li>
