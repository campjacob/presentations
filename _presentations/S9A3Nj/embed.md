      Jacob Campbell, LICSW at Heritage University
      SOWK 487 is a practice class focused on teaching skills for effecting change in clients in groups and families. There are three theories of practice courses during a studentâ€™s time in the social work program. Each one focuses on a different level of interaction. First, starting with individuals, then SOWK 487 Theories of Practice II looks at working with groups. Finally, SOWK 488 looks at working with communities and a macro perspective.
