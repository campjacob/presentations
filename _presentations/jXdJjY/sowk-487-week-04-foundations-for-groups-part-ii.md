      <p>(ROBBINS, CHATTERJEE, &amp; CANDA, 2006)
      PRINCIPALS OF EMPOWERMENT THEORY 6. Client centered with the client being encouraged to tell own story &amp; develop own goals 7. Client as “victor not victim” 8. Social change is goal, not symptom reduction. 9. Clinicians must examine how their practice may disempower clients 10.Clinician may need to be socially and politically active to address mezzo and macro needs [local, national, global issues] Jacob Campbell, LICSW Heritage University

      <p>STEPS IN EMPOWERMENT IN MICRO PRACTICE
      STEP 1: SELF-EFFICACY The rst step in empowerment theory is the empowering of the client. This means helping them to gain self-ef cacy. This can be done by the following:
      ‣ Skill building ‣ Gaining self-awareness ‣ Learning to navigate systems

      <p>STEPS IN EMPOWERMENT IN MICRO PRACTICE
      STEP 2: CRITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS The second step in empowerment theory is connecting the client to the “bigger picture.” This means helping them to gain a critical consciousness about oppression and obstacles. Some examples of this are as follows:
      ‣ Identifying barriers ‣ De ning power ‣ Connecting the client to a group ‣ Letting them know they aren’t alone fi

      <p>STEPS IN EMPOWERMENT IN MICRO PRACTICE
      STEP 3: SOCIAL CHANGE The third step in empowerment theory is creating larger social change. The following are some possible ideas:
      ‣ Creating policy and or legal changes ‣ Having the client act as a mentor ‣ Connecting to another activity that allows them to make social change

      Break Out Session 3
      Pawlukewicz and Ondrus (2013) have a journal article, Ethical dilemmas: The use of applied scenarios in the helping professions. Appendix A (at the end) has a set of numbered scenarios. Talk about the following: 3, 7, 9, 11, 17, 22, and 25.
      Garland (2010) in her book, The Groups Book Psychoanalytic Group Therapy: Principles and Practice, has a number of vignettes. I’ve provided Vignette D: Verbal abuse. Read through the example and the discussion. What are thoughts that it brings up and considerations we should have?
      Goodrich and Luke (2015) in their book, Group Counseling with LGBTQI Persons provide a number of great case examples and discussions. An example about starting an empowerment group. Read through the example and the discussion. What are thoughts that it brings up and considerations we should have?

  <p>Week four students read through chapters four, five, and six of the Garvin textbook. These include chapters focused on Brenton (2017) and empowerment perspective in groups, Barksy and Northern (2017) and ethics and values in group work, and finally, Ortega (2017) social justice practice. To start the class session, we will be completing an activity to demonstrate power dynamics, talk about empowerment perspective, and do an activity related to social justice.</p>
  <p>The agenda for today includes looking at</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Empowerment theory</li>
  <li>Ethics and social justice</li>
  </ul>
