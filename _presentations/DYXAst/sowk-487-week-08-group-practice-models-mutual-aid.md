  <p>We bring our focus back to therapeutic group models during weeks eight and ten. First, this week we will look at the less structured mutual aid groups, and then after spring break, we will be looking into cognitive-behavioral group work. We will be examining what mutual aid groups are used for, the phases of helping that happen with mutual aid, facilitation of these groups. We will also be having groups present their A-02: Family Treatment Modality Research Presentation. Reading includes Gitterman (2017) who provides a clear description of the mutual aid model. Kurtz (2017) provides valuable information about self-help groups and how they are often run and operated.</p>
