      PRINCIPALS OF EMPOWERMENT THEORY 1. All oppression should be fought 2. A systematic understanding of oppression must be maintained 3. People are capable of empowering themselves 4. People need to connect with others to work on empowerment 5. Clinician and the client share power

      <p>(ROBBINS, CHATTERJEE, &amp; CANDA, 2006)
      PRINCIPALS OF EMPOWERMENT THEORY 6. Client centered with the client being encouraged to tell own story &amp; develop own goals 7. Client as “victor not victim” 8. Social change is goal, not symptom reduction. 9. Clinicians must examine how their practice may disempower clients 10.Clinician may need to be socially and politically active to address mezzo and macro needs [local, national, global issues] Jacob Campbell, Ph.D. LICSW Heritage University

      <p>STEPS IN EMPOWERMENT IN MICRO PRACTICE
      STEP 1: SELF-EFFICACY The rst step in empowerment theory is the empowering of the client. This means helping them to gain self-ef cacy. This can be done by the following:
      ‣ Skill building ‣ Gaining self-awareness ‣ Learning to navigate systems

      <p>STEPS IN EMPOWERMENT IN MICRO PRACTICE
      STEP 2: CRITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS The second step in empowerment theory is connecting the client to the “bigger picture.” This means helping them to gain a critical consciousness about oppression and obstacles. Some examples of this are as follows:
      ‣ Identifying barriers ‣ De ning power ‣ Connecting the client to a group ‣ Letting them know they aren’t alone

      <p>STEPS IN EMPOWERMENT IN MICRO PRACTICE
      STEP 3: SOCIAL CHANGE The third step in empowerment theory is creating larger social change. The following are some possible ideas:
      ‣ Creating policy and or legal changes ‣ Having the client act as a mentor ‣ Connecting to another activity that allows them to make social change
