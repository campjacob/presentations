      <p>Types of Evaluations Used in Social Work
      • Formative Evaluations: assess the adequacy or amount of e ort directed at solving a client systems problem and gathering data during the actual intervention
      • Summarative Evaluations: an evaluation that takes place after completing the planned change process
      • Baseline: is a measure of the frequency, intensity, or duration of a behavior.

      <p>Terms Associated with Evaluations
      Reliability Validity the extent to which you are measuring what you think you are measuring
      Evaluation &amp; Termination

      is the extent to which an instrument measures the same phenomenon in the same way each time the measure is used. Reliable instruments produce consistent results over time

      Validity the extent to which you are measuring what you think you are measuring
      Evaluation &amp; Termination
      Concurrent validity exists when scores on one instrument correlate well with scores on another instrument that is already considered valid
