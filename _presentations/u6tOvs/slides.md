      <p>The readings for this week were about empowerment theory, ethics, and social justice. Whenever I think about those subjects I also get the feeling that we have to find ways to take over the world.</p>

      <p>Empowerment, Advocacy, and Leadership Activity 1 taken from (http://berkstransition.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/activity1.pdf)</p>
      <p><strong>Description</strong>: In this activity, approximately 1/3 of the participants will be given a lollipop. Each participant with a lollipop can voice their ideas and are “empowered,” while people without lollipops do not have a voice and are seen as tokens.</p>
      <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This activity can demonstrate the importance of empowerment and making sure that everyone is self-determined and has a voice.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Group Size</strong>: any size of group
      <strong>Estimated time</strong>: 15-20 minutes</p>
      <p><strong>Activity Summary</strong>: As participants are being seated (or prior to the activity), hand out lollipops to every third or fourth person (after the activity others can also have the lollipops). Participants musts be informed that the lollipops are for an activity and to wait to eat them. In this activity, participants with lollipops are people with a voice, who are empowered, and whose ideas are seen as valuable; while the participants without lollipops are seen as tokens who are not seen as having valuable ideas. This activity is meant to demonstrate the importance of empowerment and establishing your voice.</p>
      <p>Leader Instructions with a Draft Script of Directions:
      . Below there are key words that should be included in the introduction and conclusion.</p>
      <p>~Key Points~</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Give lollipops to every third to fourth participant</li>
      <li>Clearly state that the lollipops will be used for the activity and that people can get lollipops after the activity</li>
      <li>Throughout the entire activity overly emphasize how smart, amazing, beautiful, etc. the group with the lollipops are while exaggerating how much the people without lollipops are not.</li>
      <li>Introduce the icebreaker</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
      <p>State that you will be discussing how to best assist youth with
      disabilities with $1 million and want ideas from everyone</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>As you get responses, emphasize how amazing the ideas are from the people with lollipops and how much “better” they are than the others</li>
      <li>The importance here is not the ideas or ways to spend money but rather to clearly show a bias for people with lollipops</li>
      </ul>
      <p>~Concluding Points and Discussion Questions~</p>
      <ul>
      <li>After a few minutes of discussing ways to spend money end the discussion</li>
      <li>This activity wasn’t about deciding on money, it was about biases and not having your voice heard</li>
      <li>Who did we listen to? (answer: people with lollipops)</li>
      <li>We used a completely subjective and irrelevant quality as the determining factor of who we were going to listen to.</li>
      <li>Often people with disabilities may be seen as not having a lollipop and are therefore not listened to.</li>
      <li>What did it feel to not be listened to?</li>
      <li>How did you feel about the people who do have lollipops? Were you mad at them? Did you feel betrayed? Did you feel separated from them or that somehow you felt connected to other people who like you did or did not have a lollipop?</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
      <p>There are some primary principals of empowerment theory in general, not just in how it relates to working with groups.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ol>
      <li>All oppression should be fought</li>
      <li>A systematic understanding of oppression must be maintained</li>
      <li>People are capable of empowering themselves</li>
      <li>People need to connect with others to work on empowerment</li>
      <li>Clinician and the client share power</li>
      </ol>
      
  - slide_name: ../deck-6262-large-6.jpeg
    slide_text: >
      <ol start="6">
      <li>Client centered with the client being encouraged to tell own story &amp; develop own goals</li>
      <li>Client as “victor not victim”</li>
      <li>Social change is goal, not symptom reduction.</li>
      <li>Clinicians must examine how their practice may disempower clients</li>
      <li>Clinician may need to be socially and politically active to address meso and macro needs [local, national, global issues]</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The first step in empowerment theory is the empowering of the client.  This means helping them to gain self-efficacy.  This can be done by the following:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Skill building</li>
      <li>Gaining self-awareness</li>
      <li>Learning to navigate systems</li>
      </ul>
      
  - slide_name: ../deck-6262-large-8.jpeg
    slide_text: >
      <p>The second step in empowerment theory is connecting the client to the “bigger picture.”  This means helping them to gain a critical consciousness about oppression and obstacles.  Some examples of this are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Identifying barriers</li>
      <li>Defining power</li>
      <li>Connecting the client to a group</li>
      <li>Letting them know they aren’t alone</li>
      </ul>
      
  - slide_name: ../deck-6262-large-9.jpeg
    slide_text: >
      <p>The third step in empowerment theory is creating larger social change.  The following are some possible ideas:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Creating policy and or legal changes</li>
      <li>Having the client act as a mentor</li>
      <li>Connecting to another activity that allows them to make social change</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The following are the parts of doing empowerment theory with groups or in mezzo practice. It really closely aligns with steps two and three of the micro practice.</p>
