      <p>I want to have us go through and do an simple activity that you can do either with one client, with a family, or even with groups.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Description</strong>:  Have various shapes and colors cut out of construction paper.  It is important to have a lot of choices for the clients to utilize.  Ask the clients to take various pieces of construction paper and describe their family circumstances.  Tell them they can choose shapes, colors, even the layout of their family’s to describe to the group what their family looks like.  Have each of the clients describe their Genogram.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Purpose</strong>: This is an activity that helps relate family situations to the group members.  It is an activity that might go a bit deeper than some of the others, so be careful to manage how much you want to go into.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
      <li>Build on families strengths

      <li>Families have an inherent desire to “meet needs and reach goals…”</li>
      <li>Some strengths to look at…

      <li>Survivor’s pride</li>
      <li>Hope for the future</li>

      <li>[Discussion] This goes from concrete and functional to more unsure. How can these strengths be functional?</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Work collaboratively
      <ul>
      <li>Families are experts on their own lives / strengths, resources, and capacities</li>
      <li>Same as client / cultural expertDraw out what are doing already…</li>
      <li>Think SFBT <strong>looking for exceptions</strong>

      <p>The following are the general described functions of families:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Procreation</strong>: Families ensure the evolutionary survival of the human species.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Provide for physical needs</strong>: Families obtain and distribute resources that are instrumental for physical health and economic survival.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Provide secure attachment bonds</strong>: Families provide members with a sense of psychological security and safety.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Primary socialization of children</strong>: Families teach and reinforce social norms and rules necessary for successful performance in the social world.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Regulate sexuality</strong>: Family structure establishes boundaries that limit sexual relationships among its members (e.g., incest).</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Satisfy emotional needs</strong>: Families provide members with affection, companion- ship, and a sense of belonging.</li>

      <p>Chavil’s (2009) paper lays out three types of family engagement that could be laid out on a sort of a continuum.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>Family focused: more than working with just child, but whole family.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Family-centered</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>“Family-centered treatment is not simply a new technique that can be learned by frontline clinicians. Family-centered treatment involves the program’s philosophy, organization, financing, staffing, and many other policies and procedures.” (Ooms &amp; Snyder, 2007)</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Family-driven</li>
      </ul>
      <p>“Family-driven means families have a primary decision making role in the care of their own children as well as the policies and procedures governing care for all children in their community, state, tribe, territory and nation” (Chavil, 2009).</p>

      <p>Kruzich, Jivanjee, Robinson, Friesen (2003) reported the following barriers were identified by families as impeding involvement in their child’s care:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Distance from service providers</li>
      <li>Caregiver’s work schedule</li>
      <li>Cost of transportation</li>
      <li>Lack of access to transportation</li>
      <li>Child care arrangements</li>
      <li>Cost of child care</li>
      <li>Lack of communication between staff from different programs or agencies</li>
      <li>Lack of open communication</li>
      <li>Lack of opportunity or encouragement to participate in the child’s treatment</li>
      <li>Inflexible visiting and meeting schedules</li>
      <li>Lack of clarity about whom to contact with questions and concerns</li>
      <li>Negative staff attitudes about the family</li>
      <li>Restrictive policies</li>
      <li>Lack of consideration for cultural values</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Kruzich et al. (2003) described the following as identified by families as supports to their participation:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Provision of a contact person</li>
      <li>Notification of caregiver when something was wrong or if there were health or other concerns about the child</li>
      <li>Flexible scheduling of meetings</li>
      <li>Information about rights and grievance procedures</li>
      <li>Comfortable and private space for meetings</li>
      <li>Prompt return of phone calls</li>
      <li>Inclusion of caregiver’s comments in the child’s records</li>
      <li>Support for transitions into or out of services or programs</li>
      <li>Communication with all relevant family members</li>
      <li>Help with transportation costs</li>
      <li>Help with telephone costs</li>
      <li>Assistance with child care costs</li>
      <li>Caregiver treated with dignity and respect</li>
      <li>Caregiver made to feel that his or her participation was important</li>
      <li>Caregiver made to feel welcome</li>
      <li>All family members encouraged to participate</li>
      <li>Responsiveness to the family’s cultural values</li>

      <p>“There are various ways to define families. One definition is ‘A primary group whose members assume certain obligations for each other and generally share common residences.’” (Kirst-Ashman &amp; Hull, 2015, p. 331)</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Individuals in a family can be related by ancestry, marriage, adoption, or choice.</li>
      <li>A family can include two or more people who assume responsibility for each others well being over time.</li>

      <p>Family decision making power, hierarchy and power are important aspects for a social worker to be assessing and to be cognizant of. When we think abut these parts, the following are some ways that we think about them:</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>[Whole Class Activity] Discuss each topical area, and types of questions that you might ask?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Historic / Context</strong>: How power has been distributed in the family in the past and whether changing conditions of the family are threatening the established power base (McGoldrick, 1998; Okun, Fried, &amp; Okun, 1999)</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Reason for distribution</strong>: Whether the distribution of power is gender specific out of necessity for the family to survive in a hostile environment (Okun, Fried, &amp; Okun, 1999)</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Covert power</strong>: To what extent power is covertly held by members who have aligned to form a power bloc, and to what extent covert power accrues to individual members who are manifesting extreme symptoms</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Power flexibility</strong>: The extent to which the family system allows power to be flexibly reallocated and permits roles to be adjusted to meet the demands of changing circumstances</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Family perspective</strong>: How members view the distribution of power in the family (even though the distribution is unequal, family members may be satisfied with the arrangement) The role of a family’s culture in determining the distribution of power (Congress &amp; Kung, 2005)</li>

As the family faces demands from its environment and challenges from its members, its capacity to adapt is a central property of the ability to maintain itself as a cohesive unit.” (p. 267)</p>

Families are able to adapt to adversity when family members have a strong sense of dedication to each other and when their patterns of communication lend themselves to mutual understanding of family members’ thoughts, ideas, and feelings regarding adversity.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Creativity and flexibility</strong>. Families that strive for creative solutions to problems, including especially demonstrating flexibility in role assignments, enable families to find solutions to stressful situations.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Appraisal, insight, and meaning</strong>. When families strive to understand their difficulties and to find affirmative meaning in them, they have an increasing ability to sustain their problem-solving efforts under stress. Very often appraisal and insight are linked to family spirituality and belief systems.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Initiative and achievement</strong>. Families who are action oriented tend to approach problem solving using positive coping strategies such as cognitive coping, problem solving, and constructive emotional regulation strategies.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Boundary setting</strong>. Families with a strong sense of family structure will seek to shield its members from unhelpful, unhealthy, and destructive influences.</li>
