      <p>THINKING ERRORS
      AKA: COGNITIVE DISTORTIONS
      THINKING ERRORS OR COGNITIVE DISTORTIONS LEAD US TO TROUBLE WHEN WE USE THEM TO MAKE SENSE OF OUR POOR CHOICES AND ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR. WE ALSO END UP WITH CONSEQUENCES THAT WE DO NOT LIKE.
      Self-centered Thinking: Thinking about only your own needs or interests, not caring about others. One example is saying “If I lie to people, it is nobody’s business but mine.” Assuming the Worst: Acting as if the worst outcome in a situation is the only possible outcome. Thinking people are out to get you. One example is saying, “I might as well lie, people won’t believe me if I tell the truth.” Blaming Others: Not accepting responsibility for your choices and consequences. Making it seem like someone forced you to act how you did. Saying someone else is responsible. One example is saying, “People make me lie when they ask too many questions.” Minimizing/mislabeling: Thinking Errors or Cognitive Distortions lead us to trouble when we use them to make sense of our poor choices and antisocial behavior. We also end up with consequences that we do not like.</p>

      <p>REGGIE’S PROBLEM SITUATION FROM ART
      “YOUR FATHER IS LATE AGAIN,” REGGIE’S MOTHER TELLS REGGIE ONE NIGHT AS HE SITS DOWN TO DINNER. REGGIE KNOWS WHY; HE PASSED HIS FATHER’S CAR ON THE WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL. IT WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE MIDTOWN BAR AND GRILL. REGGIE’S MOTHER AND FATHER HAD ARGUED MANY TIMES ABOUT HIS FATHER’S STOPPING OFF AT THE BAR ON HIS WAY HOME FROM WORK. AFTER THEIR LAST ARGUMENT, HIS FATHER HAD PROMISED HE WOULD NEVER DO IT AGAIN. “I WONDER WHY YOUR FATHER IS LATE,” REGGIE’S MOTHER SAYS. “DO YOU THINK I SHOULD TRUST WHAT HE SAID ABOUT NOT DRINKING ANY MORE? DO YOU THINK HE STOPPED OFF AT THE BAR AGAIN?” REGGIE’S MOTHER ASKS HIM. WHAT SHOULD REGGIE SAY OR DO?</p>
