      <p>Ecological Perspective De nitions Interdependence
      the reliance on one person to another. People depend on each others input, energy, services, and consistency
      Person Energy Environment A focuses on people constantly interacting with various systems around them. So the social workers focused improving the interactions between the person and systems.
      fi
      Interface
      the exact point at which the interaction between an individual and the environment
      Adaptation
      Coping
      Transactions people communicate and interact with those in their environments [can be positive or negative]
      the natural power of active involvement among people and their environments takes place [input or output] the capacity to adjust to surrounding environmental conditions. This implies change because a person must adapt to change in order to continue functioning in their environment. Social workers help individuals during this process to direct their energies so that they are able to adapt a form of human adaptation and implies a struggle to overcome problems. Refers to the way we deal with the problems we experience.
