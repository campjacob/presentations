      <li>
      <strong>Skills training</strong>: Group leaders model positive behaviors through role plays, followed by the role-play rehearsal of new behaviors by group members. The goal is to enhance relationship skills in in order to replace abusive and other negative behaviors.</li>

      <p>Social workers can teach women about assertiveness and how to develop assertiveness skills.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p>[Discussion] How many of you have some difficulty with assertiveness? In what ways?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Assertiveness involves verbal and nonverbal behavior that is straightforward but not offensive. There are generally thought to be three different styles.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Aggressive Style (“The Persecutor”)
      <ul>
      <li>Answers before the other person is through talking, speak loudly and abusively, glare at the other person, speak “past the issue (accusing, blaming, demeaning”), vehemently expound your feelings and opinions, Value yourself “above others,” and hurt others to avoid hurting yourself</li>
      <li>Dominating, manipulating, and humiliating others</li>
      <li>Frequently hostile in interactions or ignores</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Nonassertive / Passive Style (“The Martyr”)
      <ul>
      <li>Likely to hesitate, speak softly, look away, avoid the issue, agree regarding-less of own feelings, not express opinions, value yourself “below” others, and hurt yourself to avoid any chance of hurting others</li>
      <li>Primary aim is to keep others happy</li>
      <li>Put aside her own needs and wants in deference to the wants of others because she doesn’t see herself as important</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Assertive Style (“The Balancer”)
      <ul>
      <li>You will answer spontaneously, speak with a conversational tone and volume, looking at the other person, speak to the issue, openly express your personal feelings and opinions, value yourself equally to others, and hurt neither yourself nor others</li>
      <li>Balance her needs and the needs of others</li>
      <li>Involves consideration bot yourself and others</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
