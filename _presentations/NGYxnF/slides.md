      PLANNING FOR AND USING ACTIVITIES
      SPRING 2024 SOWK 487W
      Questions to Consider
      How prescriptive should the activity be? How is the activity regulated or controlled? What are the relationship demands or levels of interaction required? What is the level of competence required?

      <p>CLARITY OF GROUP PURPOSE The purpose of the group can be stated clearly and concisely by both clients and the worker The stated purpose is the same for both clients and the worker, even if they might express it in different words The purpose is speci ic enough to provide direction and implications for group content
      a clearly de ined purpose is the powerful ally of group workers and members alike. It is crucial to the success of the groups with which we work.
      The purpose is speci ic enough so that both clients and the worker will know when it has been achieved (p. 106)

      <p>COMMON MISTAKES OF PRACTITIONERS Related to Sharing Purpose Practitioners promote a group purpose without adequate consideration of client need. Practitioners confuse group purpose with group content. Practitioners state group purpose at such a high level of generality that it is vague and meaningless and, therefore, provides little direction for the group. Practitioners are reluctant to share with the members their perceptions and ideas about the group’s purpose. Practitioners function with a hidden purpose in mind that they do not share with the group. Practitioners do not understand purpose as a dynamic, evolving concept that changes over the life of the group. Instead, they view Purpose as static and ixed.

      The exercise needs to be appropriate for the age and experience levels of participants to ensure that participants have suf icient developmental resources to bene it from the experience. Congruence between the dimensions addressed in the didactic component and the dimensions experienced in the
      Role-playing
      exercise is essential. (Furr, 2000, p. 38)
