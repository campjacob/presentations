    slide_alt: "**Object**: Presentation slide  **Action**: Displays agenda and objectives  **Context**: Week three plan  **Text**:**Agenda**:- Engage in activities that illustrate metacognitive processes and thinking styles.- Explore cognitive reflection and the difference between intuitive and analytical reasoning.- Reflect on the impact of cognitive dissonance and bias in policy analysis.- Apply systems thinking concepts to examine limitations of conventional problem-solving.**Learning Objectives**:- Differentiate between System 1 and System 2 thinking and their influence on policy analysis and decision-making.- Identify common forms of cognitive dissonance and their impact.- Recognize cognitive traps and their potential impact.- Apply systems thinking to reframe problem-solving and anticipate policy intervention consequences."

  - slide_name: deck-afBq9w-large-11.jpeg
    slide_alt: "Text on a presentation slide reads: **Left side:**'SCARED STRAIGHT PROGRAMS AS A STAND-ALONE STRATEGY ARE NOT EFFECTIVE'**Right side:**'These randomized trials, conducted over a 25-year period in eight different jurisdictions, provide evidence that 'Scared Straight' and other 'juvenile awareness' programs are not effective as a stand-alone crime prevention strategy. More importantly, they provide empirical evidence under experimental conditions - that these programs likely increase the odds that children exposed to them will commit offenses in future. Despite the variability in the type of intervention used, ranging from harsh, confrontational interactions to tours of the facility, converge on the same result: an increase in criminality in the experimental group when compared to a no-treatment control. Doing nothing would have been better than exposing juveniles to the program.' (Petrosino et al., 2013, p. 31, emphasis my own)"

    slide_alt: "Slide displaying five bullet points about interventions. It discusses outcomes of addressing symptoms, achieving short-term gains, and producing unintended consequences. Source cited: 'Stroh, 2015, Chapter 1.'"

    slide_alt: "An iceberg diagram illustrates organizational learning. The top, 'Events,' triggers 'React/Firefight.' Below, 'Trends & Patterns' prompt 'Anticipate/Forecast.' Deepest, 'Systems Structure' includes pressures and dynamics fostering change. Text: 'Leverage Learning,' 'Questions,' 'Focus,' and 'Action or Response.' Adapted from Stroh (2015)."
