    slide_alt: "Text on a presentation slide reads: **Left side:**'SCARED STRAIGHT PROGRAMS AS A STAND-ALONE STRATEGY ARE NOT EFFECTIVE'**Right side:**'These randomized trials, conducted over a 25-year period in eight different jurisdictions, provide evidence that 'Scared Straight' and other 'juvenile awareness' programs are not effective as a stand-alone crime prevention strategy. More importantly, they provide empirical evidence under experimental conditions - that these programs likely increase the odds that children exposed to them will commit offenses in future. Despite the variability in the type of intervention used, ranging from harsh, confrontational interactions to tours of the facility, converge on the same result: an increase in criminality in the experimental group when compared to a no-treatment control. Doing nothing would have been better than exposing juveniles to the program.' (Petrosino et al., 2013, p. 31, emphasis my own)"
