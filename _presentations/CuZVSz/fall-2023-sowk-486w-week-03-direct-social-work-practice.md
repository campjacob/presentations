      <p>Involuntary Clients Give them as many choices as possible including minor options. Figure out what you can do for the client that he or she wants. Use pro-social modeling and reinforcement in order to encourage and promote client pro–social values and behaviors. Allow the client to gain trust in you and in the intervention process.

      Accept the fact that, ultimately the client has the right to choose whether or not to cooperate with you. SOWK 486w Fall 2023

presentation_description: >
  <p>Week three of SOWK 486 is about understanding what direct social work practice and some of what makes social workers unique in our helping style. We will start with an exercise, considering how you have been helped in the past. Many clients we work with as social workers are mandated to participate in services involuntary in some manner. We will discuss how to engage with them through some best practices. The agenda for the session is as follows:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>How we help</li>
  <li>Orienting perspectives for social work practice</li>
  <li>Evidence-based practice</li>
  <li>Involuntary clients</li>
  <li>Ecological Systems Model</li>
  <li>Social work jobs and roles</li>
  </ul>
