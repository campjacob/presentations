      <blockquote>
      <p>“Clients often have an unclear idea about what to expect from contact with a social worker, and those ideas may differ from the social worker’s expectations as well (Kadushin &amp; Kadushin, 1997). This is most evident when the client has been referred or mandated for service. Clarifying expectations becomes a key intervention in work with clients who have not chosen to see a social worker (Rooney et al., 2009; Trotter, 2006).”</p>

      <li>
      <strong>Determine your client expectations</strong>: Ask questions to determine what their expectations. Help them to manage unrealistic or unreasonable expectations.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Emphasize client responsibility</strong>: What are the expectations that you or others have on them.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Emphasize difficulties inherent in the process</strong>: Making change is hard. Extinction burst.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Clarify your own role</strong>: What will you be doing and expectations they can have on you</li>

      <p>Carl Rodgers and person Center Counseling probably give the best and most focus on basic helping attitudes.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>The facilitative conditions (or core conditions) in helping relationships were originally denoted by Carl Rogers (1957) as…</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Empathy</li>
      <li>Unconditional positive regard</li>
      <li>Congruence</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Much of the current research describes these as:</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Warmth</p>
      </li>
      <li>

      <li>
      <p>Empathy</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Facilitative conditions are often thought to be the foundation-level skills that undergird many treatment models and help create a positive client–social worker relationship.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Research has especially supported the correlation of empathy with positive social work outcomes.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>The facilitative skills are particularly useful in treatment situations with voluntary clients.</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>With empathy being such an important skill, we need to discuss how we can develop perceptiveness to feelings. As well we know that feelings or emotions exert a powerful influence on behavior and often play a central role in the problems of clients.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>To respond to the broad spectrum of emotions and feeling states presented by clients, the social worker must be fully aware of the diversity of human emotions.

      <strong>Position of not knowing…</strong>
      </li>
      <li>They also need to take a “not knowing” position of learning what emotional expression means for the particular client in front of them.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>It is important to realize that high-level empathic responding takes place in two phases:
      <ul>
      <li>A thinking process</li>
      <li>A responding process</li>
      </ul>
      </li>

      <p>Applicants or voluntary clients often enter into the helping relationship with openness, hoping to explore both their concerns and their related feelings.</p>

      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Self-involving statements</strong> include messages that express the social worker’s personal reaction to the client during the course of a session.</li>
      <li>
