      <p>Dialectical theory states that reality is interrelated and connected, made of opposing forces, and always changing. In DBT, dialectics take the form of both a fundamental worldview as well as a method of persuasion (i.e., a set of communication strategies that the therapist uses to elicit change). (Rizvi et al., 2013, p. 76)</p>

      <p>Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Distress tolerance will help you cope better with painful events by building up your resiliency and giving you new ways to soften the e ects of upsetting circumstances. Mindfulness will help you experience more fully the present moment while focusing less on painful experiences from the past or frightening possibilities in the future. Mindfulness will also give you tools to overcome habitual, negative judgments about yourself and others. Emotion regulation skills help you to recognize more clearly what you feel and then to observe each emotion without getting overwhelmed by it. The goal is to modulate your feelings without behaving in reactive, destructive ways. Interpersonal e ectiveness gives you new tools to express your beliefs and needs, set limits, and negotiate solutions to problems‚Äîall while protecting your relationships and treating others with respect.
