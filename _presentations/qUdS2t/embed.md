      <p>Constructive Group Behavior
      fi
      􀄹
      Problematic Group Behavior
      Members openly communicate personal feelings and attitudes and anticipate that other members will be helpful.
      Members continue to keep discussions on a super cial level or avoid revealing their feelings and opinions.
      Members listen carefully to one another and give all ideas a fair hearing.
      Members are critical and evaluative of each other. They rarely acknowledge or listen to contributions from others.
      Decisions are reached through group consensus after considering everyone’s views and feelings.
      Dominant members dismiss or bully other members in decision-making
      Members make efforts to incorporate the views of dissenters or less powerful members rather than to dominate or override these views.
      Members make decisions prematurely without identifying or weighing possible alternatives.

      <p>Constructive Group Behavior Members recognize and give feedback regarding others’ strengths and growth. Members use “I” messages to speak for themselves, owning their own feelings and positions on matters. The guidelines established in initial sessions become norms. The group works out problems that impair group functioning. Members are attuned to the needs and feelings of others and give emotional support.

      GROUP BEHAVIOR
      Heritage University Jacob Campbell, Ph.D. LICSW
      Problematic Group Behavior Members are critical of others’ differences. Members do not personalize their messages but use indirect forms of communication to express their feelings and positions. Members act in distracting or disruptive ways. Members avoid talking about the here and now or addressing personal or group problems. Members show little awareness of the needs and feelings of others; emotional investment in others is limited.
