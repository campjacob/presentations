      <p>COGNITIVE RESTRUCTURING WHAT YOU DO
      Intervention techniques in CBT are designed to help clients modify their beliefs, faulty thought patterns or perceptions, and destructive verbalizations, thereby leading to changes in behavior.
      Assist client in accepting that their selfstatements, assumptions, and beliefs determine emotional reactions to events Assist clients in identifying dysfunctional selfstatements, beliefs, and thought patterns that underlie their problem. Assist clients in identifying situations that engender dysfunctional cognitions Assist clients in replacing dysfunctional cognitions with functional self-statements Assist clients in identifying rewards and incentives for successful coping e orts

      <p>Defense Mechanisms What is a defense mechanism? Situation • Disrespected • Yelled At • Put Down • Laughed At
      Choice Who chooses the defense? How do you protect your feelings?
      How do you respond (act) when: • Mad At Parent • Embarassed • You Lose • Feel Pressure
      • You’re Hit • Make A Mistake • Confronted • Frustrated
      • Blamed • Get Caught • Hurt • Angry
      Four Steps to Control Your D.M.
      Feeling</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Recognize the situation. When you are in a pressure situation, these are the signs: You feel angry, frustrated, nervous.
      e v i t a Neg
      Positi
      ve
      What outward behaviors can you use to help control the pressure? 2. Identify the situations where you can practice step 1. What are the situations you need to practice this? 3. Don’t let other people control how you will respond. You know that someone is trying to control you if they are yelling at you, physically attacking you, or putting you down.
      “Easy” “Hard” This gives you self-respect. Why?</li>
      <li>Select a positive solution. What would motivate you to do the tougher (harder) thing? What might happen if you stay in control?
      Defense How do you know when you’ve selected a positive defense mechanism?

      WHAT WOULD YOU DO? THE CRISIS INTERVENTION MODEL: PROCEDURES OF CRISIS INTERVENTION
      P. 285 Review the 8-step procedures of crisis intervention
      A 34-year-old mother of three, aged, 5, 9, and 11 has been hospitalized following a violent confrontation with her boyfriend. In addition to her physical condition, she is depressed and concerned about her children. During the period of her hospitalization, the children lived with an aunt. As the hospital social worker, you meet with her to complete a psychosocial assessment. During the brief session, she stated, “I never want to see him again (the boyfriend). If it weren’t for my children, I would hang it all up. I seem to always end up choosing the wrong men in my life. I don’t want my kids to see me as a loser but it is true, I am. I just want to get out of here and live my life with my children in peace.”

      <p>I am here because God told me to come. How is a goal going to help me? I trust God to guide me in what to do. Do you believe in God? What do you know about my situation? You are so young and it’s hard for me to see how you can help me. The court will take my children no matter what I do, so how is having a goal going to help? You need to be clear; I don’t want to be here. I’m only doing this stu with you because the judge said that I had to come. My family didn’t want me to come see you again. They worry that you will put too many American ideas in my head. Don’t waste our time. She got herself pregnant. You want her father and me to be involved because you must think that it is okay to be unmarried and pregnant. Well, you’re wrong! How will having a goal help me? I’ve never been able to accomplish anything before. FALL 2022 FOR SOWK 486W WITH JACOB CAMPBELL, LICSW AT HERITAGE UNIVERSITY ff

      This writer met with Johnny and discussed his goal progress. Johnny
      reported that he has been attempting to use deep breathing when frustrated. He described a situation last week with client 13452, and the incident where he was getting into other students belongings and handling them without permission. Johnny reported taking deep breaths instead of punching 13452. This writer encouraged this positive behavior and reflected experience back to concept of “If Then Thinking.” (I) Johnny appeared cooperative. He appeared to be encouraged by the positive feedback from staff. (P) Follow up with Johnny about progress next week regarding using deep breathing. ———————— Jacob Campbe FALL 2022 FOR SOWK 486W WITH JACOB CAMPBELL, LICSW AT HERITAGE UNIVERSITY ll
