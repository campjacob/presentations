      Dialectical Process “ Open place for a debate of ideas dialectical | ˌdīəˈlektəkəl | adjective 1 relating to the logical discussion of ideas and opinions: dialectical ingenuity. 2 concerned with or acting through opposing forces: a dialectical opposition between artistic translation and transcription. Group members can listen as one member presents the thesis, and the other the antithesis. As each member listens, he or she can use the discussion to develop a personal synthesis. (Shulman, 2020, p. 347)

      Phases in Mutual Aid Groups Case Study 7-1 Working in small groups, discuss the following: A Mutual-Aid Support Group for Persons With AIDS in Early Substance Abuse Recovery In what ways did the group leader help move the group from the beginning through the ending and transition phases of group work? Copyright © 2014. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved. LAWRENCE SHULMAN Persons with AIDS who are in substance abuse recovery struggling with similar concerns can gain support and resources through mutual-aid groups. This case study illustrates the social worker’s methods in enhancing mutual aid among participants in an intensive, 8-month, weekly group held in a residence sponsored by an AIDS Action Committee. Questions 1. What skills are evident in the group leader’s approach to working with the group and the individuals in the group? 2. What types of follow-up and supplementary services would be appropriate for clients during the life of the group and after completing the group? 3. How did the group leader address the issue of the group member–group leader dynamics referred to as the authority theme early in the first sessions? 4. What did the group leader do to create a “demand for work” in the group during the fourth session when he recognized the illusion of work? 253 LeCroy, C. W. (2014).
